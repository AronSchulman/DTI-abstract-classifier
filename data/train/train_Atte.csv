Sequence-based prediction of protein binding regions and drug-target interactions.,35135622,"Identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) is important for drug discovery. However, searching all drug-target spaces poses a major bottleneck. Therefore, recently many deep learning models have been proposed to address this problem. However, the developers of these deep learning models have neglected interpretability in model construction, which is closely related to a model's performance. We hypothesized that training a model to predict important regions on a protein sequence would increase DTI prediction performance and provide a more interpretable model. Consequently, we constructed a deep learning model, named Highlights on Target Sequences (HoTS), which predicts binding regions (BRs) between a protein sequence and a drug ligand, as well as DTIs between them. To train the model, we collected complexes of protein-ligand interactions and protein sequences of binding sites and pretrained the model to predict BRs for a given protein sequence-ligand pair via object detection employing transformers. After pretraining the BR prediction, we trained the model to predict DTIs from a compound token designed to assign attention to BRs. We confirmed that training the BRs prediction model indeed improved the DTI prediction performance. The proposed HoTS model showed good performance in BR prediction on independent test datasets even though it does not use 3D structure information in its prediction. Furthermore, the HoTS model achieved the best performance in DTI prediction on test datasets. Additional analysis confirmed the appropriate attention for BRs and the importance of transformers in BR and DTI prediction.

A Robust Drug-Target Interaction Prediction Framework with Capsule Network and Transfer Learning.,37762364,"Drug-target interactions (DTIs) are considered a crucial component of drug design and drug discovery. To date, many computational methods were developed for drug-target interactions, but they are insufficiently informative for accurately predicting DTIs due to the lack of experimentally verified negative datasets, inaccurate molecular feature representation, and ineffective DTI classifiers. Therefore, we address the limitations of randomly selecting negative DTI data from unknown drug-target pairs by establishing two experimentally validated datasets and propose a capsule network-based framework called CapBM-DTI to capture hierarchical relationships of drugs and targets, which adopts pre-trained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) for contextual sequence feature extraction from target proteins through transfer learning and the message-passing neural network (MPNN) for the 2-D graph feature extraction of compounds to accurately and robustly identify drug-target interactions. We compared the performance of CapBM-DTI with state-of-the-art methods using four experimentally validated DTI datasets of different sizes, including human (<i>Homo sapiens</i>) and worm (<i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>) species datasets, as well as three subsets (new compounds, new proteins, and new pairs). Our results demonstrate that the proposed model achieved robust performance and powerful generalization ability in all experiments. The case study on treating COVID-19 demonstrates the applicability of the model in virtual screening.",1,"A Robust Drug-Target Interaction Prediction Framework with Capsule Network and Transfer Learning.

BiComp-DTA: Drug-target binding affinity prediction through complementary biological-related and compression-based featurization approach.,37000857,"Drug-target binding affinity prediction plays a key role in the early stage of drug discovery.

In this study, we propose a unified measure for protein sequence encoding, named BiComp, which provides compression-based and evolutionary-related features from the protein sequences. Specifically, we employ Normalized Compression Distance and Smith-Waterman measures for capturing complementary information from the algorithmic information theory and biological domains, respectively. We utilize the proposed measure to encode the input proteins feeding a new deep neural network-based method for drug-target binding affinity prediction, named BiComp-DTA.

Multi-scaled self-attention for drug-target interaction prediction based on multi-granularity representation.,35922768,"Background: Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction plays a crucial role in drug discovery.

Results: In this paper, we propose a multi-granularity multi-scaled self-attention (SAN) model by alleviating the above problems.

Predicting affinity through homology (PATH): interpretable binding affinity prediction with persistent homology,38014181,"Accurate binding affinity prediction is crucial to structure-based drug design. Recent work used computational topology to obtain an effective representation of protein-ligand interactions. Although persistent homology encodes geometric features, previous works on binding affinity prediction using persistent homology employed uninterpretable machine learning models and failed to explain the underlying geometric and topological features that drive accurate binding affinity prediction. In this work, we propose a novel, interpretable algorithm for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. Our algorithm achieves interpretability through an effective embedding of distances across bipartite matchings of the protein and ligand atoms into real-valued functions by summing Gaussians centered at features constructed by persistent homology. We name these functions <i>internuclear persistent contours (IPCs)</i> . Next, we introduce <i>persistence fingerprints</i> , a vector with 10 components that sketches the distances of different bipartite matching between protein and ligand atoms, refined from IPCs. Let the number of protein atoms in the protein-ligand complex be <i>n</i> , number of ligand atoms be <i>m</i> , and <i>ω</i> ≈ 2.4 be the matrix multiplication exponent.

Moreover, PATH has the advantage of being interpretable.

Modality-DTA: Multimodality Fusion Strategy for Drug-Target Affinity Prediction.,36083952,"Prediction of the drug-target affinity (DTA) plays an important role in drug discovery. Existing deep learning methods for DTA prediction typically leverage a single modality, namely simplified molecular input line entry specification (SMILES) or amino acid sequence to learn representations. SMILES or amino acid sequences can be encoded into different modalities. Multimodality data provide different kinds of information, with complementary roles for DTA prediction. We propose Modality-DTA, a novel deep learning method for DTA prediction that leverages the multimodality of drugs and targets. A group of backward propagation neural networks is applied to ensure the completeness of the reconstruction process from the latent feature representation to original multimodality data. The tag between the drug and target is used to reduce the noise information in the latent representation from multimodality data. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our Modality-DTA outperforms existing methods in all metrics.

Prediction of the drug-target affinity (DTA) plays an important role in drug discovery. Existing deep learning methods for DTA prediction typically leverage a single modality, namely simplified molecular input line entry specification (SMILES) or amino acid sequence to learn representations. SMILES or amino acid sequences can be encoded into different modalities. Multimodality data provide different kinds of information, with complementary roles for DTA prediction. We propose Modality-DTA, a novel deep learning method for DTA prediction that leverages the multimodality of drugs and targets. A group of backward propagation neural networks is applied to ensure the completeness of the reconstruction process from the latent feature representation to original multimodality data. The tag between the drug and target is used to reduce the noise information in the latent representation from multimodality data. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our Modality-DTA outperforms existing methods in all metrics. Modality-DTA reduces the mean square error by 15.7% and improves the area under the precisionrecall curve by 12.74% in the Davis dataset.

Transformer-Based Molecular Generative Model for Antiviral Drug Design.,37366644,"Since the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) is oriented to the atomic-level representation of molecules and is not friendly in terms of human readability and editable, however, IUPAC is the closest to natural language and is very friendly in terms of human-oriented readability and performing molecular editing, we can manipulate IUPAC to generate corresponding new molecules and produce programming-friendly molecular forms of SMILES. In addition, antiviral drug design, especially analogue-based drug design, is also more appropriate to edit and design directly from the functional group level of IUPAC than from the atomic level of SMILES, since designing analogues involves altering the R group only, which is closer to the knowledge-based molecular design of a chemist. Herein, we present a novel data-driven self-supervised pretraining generative model called 'TransAntivirus' to make select-and-replace edits and convert organic molecules into the desired properties for design of antiviral candidate analogues. The results indicated that TransAntivirus is significantly superior to the control models in terms of novelty, validity, uniqueness, and diversity. TransAntivirus showed excellent performance in the design and optimization of nucleoside and non-nucleoside analogues by chemical space analysis and property prediction analysis.

DTI-SNNFRA: Drug-target interaction prediction by shared nearest neighbors and fuzzy-rough approximation.,33606741,"In-silico prediction of repurposable drugs is an effective drug discovery strategy that supplements de-nevo drug discovery from scratch.

Here, we have proposed DTI-SNNFRA, a framework for predicting drug-target interaction (DTI), based on shared nearest neighbour (SNN) and fuzzy-rough approximation (FRA). It uses sampling techniques to collectively reduce the vast search space covering the available drugs, targets and millions of interactions between them.

Next, it computes the degree of fuzzy-rough approximations and proper degree threshold selection for the negative samples' undersampling from all possible interaction pairs between drugs and targets obtained in the first stage. Finally, classification is performed using the positive and selected negative samples. We have evaluated the efficacy of DTI-SNNFRA using AUC (Area under ROC Curve), Geometric Mean, and F1 Score.

Drug-Target Interaction Prediction Using Multi-Head Self-Attention and Graph Attention Network.,33956632,"Identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) is an important step in the process of new drug discovery and drug repositioning. Accurate predictions for DTIs can improve the efficiency in the drug discovery and development. Although rapid advances in deep learning technologies have generated various computational methods, it is still appealing to further investigate how to design efficient networks for predicting DTIs. In this study, we propose an end-to-end deep learning method (called MHSADTI) to predict DTIs based on the graph attention network and multi-head self-attention mechanism. First, the characteristics of drugs and proteins are extracted by the graph attention network and multi-head self-attention mechanism, respectively. Then, the attention scores are used to consider which amino acid subsequence in a protein is more important for the drug to predict its interactions. Finally, we predict DTIs by a fully connected layer after obtaining the feature vectors of drugs and proteins. MHSADTI takes advantage of self-attention mechanism for obtaining long-dependent contextual relationship in amino acid sequences and predicting DTI interpretability. More effective molecular characteristics are also obtained by the attention mechanism in graph attention networks.

Compared to traditional methods, deep learning methods provide a new way for DTA prediction to achieve good performance without much knowledge of the biochemical background. However, there are still room for improvement in DTA prediction: (1) only focusing on the information of the atom leads to an incomplete representation of the molecular graph; (2) the self-supervised learning method could be introduced for protein representation. In this paper, a DTA prediction model using the deep learning method is proposed, which uses an undirected-CMPNN for molecular embedding and combines CPCProt and MLM models for protein embedding. An attention mechanism is introduced to discover the important part of the protein sequence. The proposed method is evaluated on the datasets Ki and Davis, and the model outperformed other deep learning methods. The proposed model improves the performance of the DTA prediction, which provides a novel strategy for deep learning-based virtual screening methods."
GEFA: Early Fusion Approach in Drug-Target Affinity Prediction.,34197324,"Predicting the interaction between a compound and a target is crucial for rapid drug repurposing. Deep learning has been successfully applied in drug-target affinity (DTA)problem. However, previous deep learning-based methods ignore modeling the direct interactions between drug and protein residues. This would lead to inaccurate learning of target representation which may change due to the drug binding effects. In addition, previous DTA methods learn protein representation solely based on a small number of protein sequences in DTA datasets while neglecting the use of proteins outside of the DTA datasets. We propose GEFA (Graph Early Fusion Affinity), a novel graph-in-graph neural network with attention mechanism to address the changes in target representation because of the binding effects. Specifically, a drug is modeled as a graph of atoms, which then serves as a node in a larger graph of residues-drug complex. The resulting model is an expressive deep nested graph neural network. We also use pre-trained protein representation powered by the recent effort of learning contextualized protein representation.

BindingSite-AugmentedDTA: enabling a next-generation pipeline for interpretable prediction models in drug repurposing.,37096593,"While research into drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is fairly mature, generalizability and interpretability are not always addressed in the existing works in this field. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based framework, called BindingSite-AugmentedDTA, which improves drug-target affinity (DTA) predictions by reducing the search space of potential-binding sites of the protein, thus making the binding affinity prediction more efficient and accurate. Our BindingSite-AugmentedDTA is highly generalizable as it can be integrated with any DL-based regression model, while it significantly improves their prediction performance. Also, unlike many existing models, our model is highly interpretable due to its architecture and self-attention mechanism, which can provide a deeper understanding of its underlying prediction mechanism by mapping attention weights back to protein-binding sites. The computational results confirm that our framework can enhance the prediction performance of seven state-of-the-art DTA prediction algorithms in terms of four widely used evaluation metrics, including concordance index, mean squared error, modified squared correlation coefficient ($r^2_m$) and the area under the precision curve.

SAM-DTA: a sequence-agnostic model for drug-target binding affinity prediction.,36545795,"Drug-target binding affinity prediction is a fundamental task for drug discovery and has been studied for decades. Most methods follow the canonical paradigm that processes the inputs of the protein (target) and the ligand (drug) separately and then combines them together. In this study we demonstrate, surprisingly, that a model is able to achieve even superior performance without access to any protein-sequence-related information. Instead, a protein is characterized completely by the ligands that it interacts. Specifically, we treat different proteins separately, which are jointly trained in a multi-head manner, so as to learn a robust and universal representation of ligands that is generalizable across proteins. Empirical evidences show that the novel paradigm outperforms its competitive sequence-based counterpart, with the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.4261 versus 0.7612 and the R-Square of 0.7984 versus 0.6570 compared with DeepAffinity.

Drug-target binding affinity prediction is a fundamental task for drug discovery and has been studied for decades. Most methods follow the canonical paradigm that processes the inputs of the protein (target) and the ligand (drug) separately and then combines them together. In this study we demonstrate, surprisingly, that a model is able to achieve even superior performance without access to any protein-sequence-related information. Instead, a protein is characterized completely by the ligands that it interacts. Specifically, we treat different proteins separately, which are jointly trained in a multi-head manner, so as to learn a robust and universal representation of ligands that is generalizable across proteins. Empirical evidences show that the novel paradigm outperforms its competitive sequence-based counterpart, with the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.4261 versus 0.7612 and the R-Square of 0.7984 versus 0.6570 compared with DeepAffinity.

Drug repurposing and prediction of multiple interaction types via graph embedding.,37193964,"Finding drugs that can interact with a specific target to induce a desired therapeutic outcome is key deliverable in drug discovery for targeted treatment.

Drug-target affinity prediction method based on multi-scale information interaction and graph optimization.,37907030,"Drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction as an emerging and effective method is widely applied to explore the strength of drug-target interactions in drug development research.

However, existing DTA prediction models mainly use graphical representations of drug molecules, which lack information on interactions between individual substructures, thus affecting prediction accuracy and model interpretability. Therefore, transformer and diffusion on drug graphs in DTA prediction (TDGraphDTA) are introduced to predict drug-target interactions using multi-scale information interaction and graph optimization.
