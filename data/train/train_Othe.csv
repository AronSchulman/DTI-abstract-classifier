Establishment and validation of prognostic nomograms to predict overall survival and cancer-specific survival for patients with osteosarcoma.,33118831,"This study aimed to develop and validate nomograms predicting the survival of osteosarcoma patients from the SEER database and our hospital. Data of 1,066 osteosarcoma patients from the SEER database were randomly divided into a development cohort (n=800) and validation cohort one (n=266).
Another cohort of 126 patients from our hospital was utilized as validation cohort two. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were performed to identify the independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Nomograms predicting the 3- and 5-year OS and
CSS probability were constructed and validated. The predictive performances of the established nomograms were evaluated by the concordance index (C-index) and the calibration plot. Variables of age, surgical stage, surgery, grade, tumor site, and tumor size were identified as independent
prognosticators for OS and CSS in Cox analyses. The C-indexes for OS and CSS in the development cohort were 0.818 and 0.829. Comparatively, the C-indexes for OS and CSS were 0.843 and 0.834, 0.736 and 0.782 for validation cohort one and two, respectively. Calibration plots showed excellent
consistency between nomogram prediction and actual survival.

Drug-target interactions prediction via deep collaborative filtering with multiembeddings.,35043158,"Drug-target interactions (DTIs) prediction research presents important significance for promoting the development of modern medicine and pharmacology. Traditional biochemical experiments for DTIs prediction confront the challenges including long time period, high cost and high failure

multiembeddings), which can jointly utilize multiple feature information from multiembeddings. Two different representation learning algorithms are first employed to extract heterogeneous network features. DCFME uses the generated low-dimensional dense vectors as input, and then simulates the
drug-target relationship from the perspective of both couplings and heterogeneity. In addition, the model employs focal loss that concentrates the loss on sparse and hard samples in the training process. Comparative experiments with five baseline methods show that DCFME achieves more significant

"Deciphering the pharmacological mechanisms of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi on oral leukoplakia by combining network pharmacology, molecular docking and experimental evaluations.",35667260,"Oral leukoplakia (OLK), an uncharacterized pathological condition that occurs as a white patch in the oral mucosa, is the most common precancerous condition. Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (SBG) is a medicinal plant with a wide range of pharmacological effects. Increased evidence shows
that SBG has potential therapeutic effects on OLK. However, the therapeutic mechanisms of SBG against OLK have not yet been completely elucidated. This study aimed to clarify the active components and multi-target mechanisms of SBG against OLK via network pharmacology, molecular docking and
experimental evaluations. The active components and related targets of SBG were screened by the TCMSP database and Swiss Target Prediction database. Potential therapeutic targets of OLK were collected using the GeneCards and OMIM databases. Then, we established protein-protein interaction (PPI),
compound-target-disease (C-T-D), and compound-target-pathway (C-T-P) networks by Cytoscape to identify the main components, core targets, and pharmacological pathways of SBG against OLK via applying data mining techniques and topological parameters. Metascape database was utilized for GO and KEGG
pathway analysis. Molecular docking techniques were used to estimate the binding force between the components and the hub genes. Subsequently, a series of in vitro experiments, specifically CCK-8 assay, clone formation assay, wound healing assay, flow cytometry, RT-qPCR and western blotting were
conducted for further verification. There were 25 active components and 31 related target genes in SBG against OLK. PPI analysis showed that Akt1, VEGFA, EGFR, HIF1A and PTGS2 shared the highest centrality among all target genes. KEGG pathway analysis found that PI3K-Akt signaling pathway may occupy
core status in the anti-OLK system. Molecular docking results showed that the main active components of SBG had a strong binding affinity to the hub genes. In vitro experiments showed that the leading component baicalein may inhibit proliferation, block cells in the S phase, induce DOK cell
apoptosis, and downregulate the mRNA expression of 5 hub genes by inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway activation. The most predominant component of SBG against OLK was baicalein and the key pathway was PI3K/Akt. The main components and hub genes had robust binding abilities. In vitro experiments

Predicting Affinity Through Homology (PATH): Interpretable Binding Affinity Prediction with Persistent Homology.,38014181,"Accurate binding affinity prediction is crucial to structure-based drug design. Recent work used computational topology to obtain an effective representation of protein-ligand interactions. Although persistent homology encodes geometric features, previous works on binding affinity
prediction using persistent homology employed uninterpretable machine learning models and failed to explain the underlying geometric and topological features that drive accurate binding affinity prediction. In this work, we propose a novel, interpretable algorithm for protein-ligand binding affinity
prediction. Our algorithm achieves interpretability through an effective embedding of distances across bipartite matchings of the protein and ligand atoms into real-valued functions by summing Gaussians centered at features constructed by persistent homology. We name these functions <i>internuclear
persistent contours (IPCs)</i> . Next, we introduce <i>persistence fingerprints</i> , a vector with 10 components that sketches the distances of different bipartite matching between protein and ligand atoms, refined from IPCs. Let the number of protein atoms in the protein-ligand complex be <i>n</i>
, number of ligand atoms be <i>m</i> , and <i>ω</i> ≈ 2.4 be the matrix multiplication exponent. We show that for any 0 < <i>ε</i> < 1, after an 𝒪 ( <i>mn</i> log( <i>mn</i> )) preprocessing procedure, we can compute an <i>ε</i> -accurate approximation to the persistence fingerprint in 𝒪 ( <i>m</i>
log <sup>6 <i>ω</i></sup> ( <i>m/""</i> )) time, independent of protein size. This is an improvement in time complexity by a factor of 𝒪 (( <i>m</i> + <i>n</i> ) <sup>3</sup> ) over any previous binding affinity prediction that uses persistent homology. We show that the representational power of
persistence fingerprint generalizes to protein-ligand binding datasets beyond the training dataset. Then, we introduce <i>PATH</i> , Predicting Affinity Through Homology, an interpretable, small ensemble of shallow regression trees for binding affinity prediction from persistence fingerprints. We
show that despite using 1,400-fold fewer features, PATH has comparable performance to a previous state-of-the-art binding affinity prediction algorithm that uses persistent homology features. Moreover, PATH has the advantage of being interpretable. Finally, we visualize the features captured by

Although persistent homology encodes geometric features, previous works on binding affinity
prediction using persistent homology employed uninterpretable machine learning models and failed to explain the underlying geometric and topological features that drive accurate binding affinity prediction. In this work, we propose a novel, interpretable algorithm for protein-ligand binding affinity
prediction. Our algorithm achieves interpretability through an effective embedding of distances across bipartite matchings of the protein and ligand atoms into real-valued functions by summing Gaussians centered at features constructed by persistent homology. We name these functions <i>internuclear
persistent contours (IPCs)</i> . Next, we introduce <i>persistence fingerprints</i> , a vector with 10 components that sketches the distances of different bipartite matching between protein and ligand atoms, refined from IPCs. Let the number of protein atoms in the protein-ligand complex be <i>n</i>
, number of ligand atoms be <i>m</i> , and <i>ω</i> ≈ 2.4 be the matrix multiplication exponent. We show that for any 0 < <i>ε</i> < 1, after an 𝒪 ( <i>mn</i> log( <i>mn</i> )) preprocessing procedure, we can compute an <i>ε</i> -accurate approximation to the persistence fingerprint in 𝒪 ( <i>m</i>
log <sup>6 <i>ω</i></sup> ( <i>m/""</i> )) time, independent of protein size. This is an improvement in time complexity by a factor of 𝒪 (( <i>m</i> + <i>n</i> ) <sup>3</sup> ) over any previous binding affinity prediction that uses persistent homology. We show that the representational power of
persistence fingerprint generalizes to protein-ligand binding datasets beyond the training dataset. Then, we introduce <i>PATH</i> , Predicting Affinity Through Homology, an interpretable, small ensemble of shallow regression trees for binding affinity prediction from persistence fingerprints. We
show that despite using 1,400-fold fewer features, PATH has comparable performance to a previous state-of-the-art binding affinity prediction algorithm that uses persistent homology features. Moreover, PATH has the advantage of being interpretable. Finally, we visualize the features captured by
persistence fingerprint for variant HIV-1 protease complexes and show that persistence fingerprint captures binding-relevant structural mutations. The source code for PATH is released open-source as part of the osprey protein design software package."
Multiple similarity drug-target interaction prediction with random walks and matrix factorization.,36070659,"The discovery of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a very promising area of research with great potential. The accurate identification of reliable interactions among drugs and proteins via computational methods, which typically leverage heterogeneous information retrieved from diverse
data sources, can boost the development of effective pharmaceuticals. Although random walk and matrix factorization techniques are widely used in DTI prediction, they have several limitations. Random walk-based embedding generation is usually conducted in an unsupervised manner, while the linear
similarity combination in matrix factorization distorts individual insights offered by different views. To tackle these issues, we take a multi-layered network approach to handle diverse drug and target similarities, and propose a novel optimization framework, called Multiple similarity
DeepWalk-based Matrix Factorization (MDMF), for DTI prediction. The framework unifies embedding generation and interaction prediction, learning vector representations of drugs and targets that not only retain higher order proximity across all hyper-layers and layer-specific local invariance, but
also approximate the interactions with their inner product. Furthermore, we develop an ensemble method (MDMF2A) that integrates two instantiations of the MDMF model, optimizing the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC),

the statistical values concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.88, the mean value r(2)m of 0.66 and Q(2)F3 of 0.89. Based on the CoMFA interaction contours, 13 new potential inhibitors with high predicted activity were designed, and the activities were verified by in vitro measurements. This
work proposes an effective approach for the design and activity prediction of new potential substrate-based SIRT1 inhibitors."
Predicting the Reliability of Drug-target Interaction Predictions with Maximum Coverage of Target Space.,28630414,"Many computational methods to predict the macromolecular targets of small organic molecules have been presented to date.

relatively small number of targets, are not systematically validated on drugs (whose targets are harder to predict than those of non-drug molecules) and often lack a reliability score associated with each predicted target. Here we present a systematic validation of ligand-centric target prediction
methods on a set of clinical drugs. These methods exploit a knowledge-base covering 887,435 known ligand-target associations between 504,755 molecules and 4,167 targets. Based on this dataset, we provide a new estimate of the polypharmacology of drugs, which on average have 11.5 targets below
IC<sub>50</sub> 10 µM. The average performance achieved across clinical drugs is remarkable (0.348 precision and 0.423 recall, with large drug-dependent variability), especially given the unusually large coverage of the target space. Furthermore, we show how a sparse ligand-target bioactivity matrix
to retrospectively validate target prediction methods could underestimate prospective performance.

Multitype Perception Method for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction.,37314917,"With the growing popularity of artificial intelligence in drug discovery, many deep-learning technologies have been used to automatically predict unknown drug-target interactions (DTIs).

retaining the specifical features across different interaction types; this maximizes the prediction performance for each interaction type. The multitype predictor calculates the type similarity between the type perceptor and predicted interactions, and the domain gate module is reconstructed to

Therefore, efficiently and effectively identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) has been the focus of research. At present, many machine learning algorithms are used for predicting DTIs. The key
idea is to train the classifier using an existing DTI to predict a new or unknown DTI. However, there are various challenges, such as class imbalance and the parameter optimization of many classifiers, that need to be solved before an optimal DTI model is developed. In this study, we propose a
framework called SSELM-neg for DTI prediction, in which we use a screening approach to choose high-quality negative samples and a spherical search approach to optimize the parameters of the extreme learning machine. The results demonstrated that the proposed technique outperformed other
state-of-the-art methods in 10-fold cross-validation experiments in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.986, 0.993, 0.988, and 0.969) and AUPR (0.982, 0.991, 0.982, and 0.946) for the enzyme dataset, G-protein coupled receptor dataset, ion channel dataset, and
nuclear receptor dataset, respectively. The screening approach produced high-quality negative samples with the same number of positive samples, which solved the class imbalance problem. We optimized an extreme learning machine using a spherical search approach to identify DTIs. Therefore, our models
performed better than other state-of-the-art methods."

DEDTI versus IEDTI: efficient and predictive models of drug-target interactions.,37286613,"Drug repurposing is an active area of research that aims to decrease the cost and time of drug development. Most of those efforts are primarily concerned with the prediction of drug-target interactions. Many evaluation models, from matrix factorization to more cutting-edge deep neural
networks, have come to the scene to identify such relations. Some predictive models are devoted to the prediction's quality, and others are devoted to the efficiency of the predictive models, e.g., embedding generation. In this work, we propose new representations of drugs and targets useful for
more prediction and analysis. Using these representations, we propose two inductive, deep network models of IEDTI and DEDTI for drug-target interaction prediction. Both of them use the accumulation of new representations. The IEDTI takes advantage of triplet and maps the input accumulated similarity
features into meaningful embedding corresponding vectors. Then, it applies a deep predictive model to each drug-target pair to evaluate their interaction. The DEDTI directly uses the accumulated similarity feature vectors of drugs and targets and applies a predictive model on each pair to identify
their interactions. We have done a comprehensive simulation on the DTINet dataset as well as gold standard datasets, and the results show that DEDTI outperforms IEDTI and the state-of-the-art models.

GIFDTI: Prediction of Drug-Target Interactions Based on Global Molecular and Intermolecular Interaction Representation Learning.,36445997,"Drug discovery and drug repurposing often rely on the successful prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs). Recent advances have shown great promise in applying deep learning to drug-target interaction prediction. One challenge in building deep learning-based models is to adequately
represent drugs and proteins that encompass the fundamental local chemical environments and long-distance information among amino acids of proteins (or atoms of drugs). Another challenge is to efficiently model the intermolecular interactions between drugs and proteins, which plays vital roles in
the DTIs. To this end, we propose a novel model, GIFDTI, which consists of three key components: the sequence feature extractor (CNNFormer), the global molecular feature extractor (GF), and the intermolecular interaction modeling module (IIF). Specifically, CNNFormer incorporates CNN and Transformer
to capture the local patterns and encode the long-distance relationship among tokens (atoms or amino acids) in a sequence. Then, GF and IIF extract the global molecular features and the intermolecular interaction features, respectively. We evaluate GIFDTI on six realistic evaluation strategies and
the results show it improves DTI prediction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, case studies confirm that our model can be a useful tool to accurately yield low-cost DTIs.

De Novo Prediction of Drug-Target Interactions Using Laplacian Regularized Schatten <b><i>p</i></b>-Norm Minimization.,33481664,"<b>In pharmaceutical sciences, a crucial step of the drug discovery is the identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs).
