Multitype Perception Method for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction.,37314917,"With the growing popularity of artificial intelligence in drug discovery, many deep-learning technologies have been used to automatically predict unknown drug-target interactions (DTIs). A unique challenge in using these technologies to predict DTI is fully exploiting the knowledge
diversity across different interaction types, such as drug-drug, drug-target, drug-enzyme, drug-path, and drug-structure types. Unfortunately, existing methods tend to learn the specifical knowledge on each interaction type and they usually ignore the knowledge diversity across different interaction
types. Therefore, we propose a multitype perception method (MPM) for DTI prediction by exploiting knowledge diversity across different link types. The method consists of two main components: a type perceptor and a multitype predictor. The type perceptor learns distinguished edge representations by
retaining the specifical features across different interaction types; this maximizes the prediction performance for each interaction type. The multitype predictor calculates the type similarity between the type perceptor and predicted interactions, and the domain gate module is reconstructed to
assign an adaptive weight to each type perceptor. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed MPM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in DTI prediction.",0,"Multitype Perception Method for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction.

Fusing Sequence and Structural Knowledge by Heterogeneous Models to Accurately and Interpretively Predict Drug-Target Affinity.,38138496,"Drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction is crucial for understanding molecular interactions and aiding drug discovery and development. While various computational methods have been proposed for DTA prediction, their predictive accuracy remains limited, failing to delve into the structural
nuances of interactions. With increasingly accurate and accessible structure prediction of targets, we developed a novel deep learning model, named S2DTA, to accurately predict DTA by fusing sequence features of drug SMILES, targets, and pockets and their corresponding graph structural features
using heterogeneous models based on graph and semantic networks. Experimental findings underscored that complex feature representations imparted negligible enhancements to the model's performance. However, the integration of heterogeneous models demonstrably bolstered predictive accuracy. In
comparison to three state-of-the-art methodologies, such as DeepDTA, GraphDTA, and DeepDTAF, S2DTA's performance became more evident. It exhibited a 25.2% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) and a 20.1% decrease in root mean square error (RMSE). Additionally, S2DTA showed some improvements in
other crucial metrics, including Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Spearman, Concordance Index (CI), and <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>, with these metrics experiencing increases of 19.6%, 17.5%, 8.1%, and 49.4%, respectively. Finally, we conducted an interpretability analysis on the effectiveness of

A novel proteochemometrics model for predicting the inhibition of nine carbonic anhydrase isoforms based on supervised Laplacian score and k-nearest neighbour regression.,29882433,"Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are essential enzymes in biological processes.

such as self-training support vector machine (SVM) and BLM, to develop a self-training bipartite local model (SELF-BLM) that facilitates the identification of potential interactions. The method first categorizes unlabeled interactions and negative interactions among unknown interactions using a
clustering method. Then, using the BLM method and self-training SVM, the unlabeled interactions are self-trained and final local classification models are constructed. When applied to four classes of proteins that include enzymes, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and nuclear

promise, they often categorize unknown interactions as negative interaction. Therefore, these methods are not ideal for finding potential drug-target interactions that have not yet been validated as positive interactions. Thus, here we propose a method that integrates machine learning techniques,
such as self-training support vector machine (SVM) and BLM, to develop a self-training bipartite local model (SELF-BLM) that facilitates the identification of potential interactions. The method first categorizes unlabeled interactions and negative interactions among unknown interactions using a
clustering method. Then, using the BLM method and self-training SVM, the unlabeled interactions are self-trained and final local classification models are constructed. When applied to four classes of proteins that include enzymes, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and nuclear
receptors, SELF-BLM showed the best performance for predicting not only known interactions but also potential interactions in three protein classes compare to other related studies. The implemented software and supporting data are available at https://github.com/GIST-CSBL/SELF-BLM."

Linear Interaction Energy Based Prediction of Cytochrome P450 1A2 Binding Affinities with Reliability Estimation.,26551865,"Prediction of human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) binding affinities of small ligands, i.e., substrates and inhibitors, represents an important task for predicting drug-drug interactions.

In silico analysis predicting effects of deleterious SNPs of human RASSF5 gene on its structure and functions.,32884013,"Ras association domain-containing protein 5 (RASSF5), one of the prospective biomarkers for tumors, generally plays a crucial role as a tumor suppressor.

persistence fingerprint for variant HIV-1 protease complexes and show that persistence fingerprint captures binding-relevant structural mutations. The source code for PATH is released open-source as part of the osprey protein design software package."

toxicity, crossing blood-brain barrier (BBB) ability, and human intestinal absorption."
"Deciphering the pharmacological mechanisms of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi on oral leukoplakia by combining network pharmacology, molecular docking and experimental evaluations.",35667260,"Oral leukoplakia (OLK), an uncharacterized pathological condition that occurs as a white patch in the oral mucosa, is the most common precancerous condition. Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (SBG) is a medicinal plant with a wide range of pharmacological effects. Increased evidence shows
that SBG has potential therapeutic effects on OLK. However, the therapeutic mechanisms of SBG against OLK have not yet been completely elucidated. This study aimed to clarify the active components and multi-target mechanisms of SBG against OLK via network pharmacology, molecular docking and
experimental evaluations. The active components and related targets of SBG were screened by the TCMSP database and Swiss Target Prediction database. Potential therapeutic targets of OLK were collected using the GeneCards and OMIM databases. Then, we established protein-protein interaction (PPI),
compound-target-disease (C-T-D), and compound-target-pathway (C-T-P) networks by Cytoscape to identify the main components, core targets, and pharmacological pathways of SBG against OLK via applying data mining techniques and topological parameters. Metascape database was utilized for GO and KEGG
pathway analysis. Molecular docking techniques were used to estimate the binding force between the components and the hub genes. Subsequently, a series of in vitro experiments, specifically CCK-8 assay, clone formation assay, wound healing assay, flow cytometry, RT-qPCR and western blotting were
conducted for further verification. There were 25 active components and 31 related target genes in SBG against OLK. PPI analysis showed that Akt1, VEGFA, EGFR, HIF1A and PTGS2 shared the highest centrality among all target genes. KEGG pathway analysis found that PI3K-Akt signaling pathway may occupy
core status in the anti-OLK system. Molecular docking results showed that the main active components of SBG had a strong binding affinity to the hub genes. In vitro experiments showed that the leading component baicalein may inhibit proliferation, block cells in the S phase, induce DOK cell
apoptosis, and downregulate the mRNA expression of 5 hub genes by inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway activation. The most predominant component of SBG against OLK was baicalein and the key pathway was PI3K/Akt. The main components and hub genes had robust binding abilities. In vitro experiments

Prediction of Drug-Target Interactions Based on Network Representation Learning and Ensemble Learning.,32340959,"Identifying interactions between drugs and target proteins is a critical step in the drug development process, as it helps identify new targets for drugs and accelerate drug development.

ones (negative samples), which forms a class imbalance. Most previous methods only utilised part of the negative samples to train the prediction model, so most of the information on negative samples was neglected. Therefore, a new method must be developed to predict candidate drug-related proteins
and fully utilise negative samples to improve prediction performance. We present a method based on non-negative matrix factorisation and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), named NGDTP, to identify the candidate drug-protein interactions. NGDTP integrates multiple kinds of protein similarities,
drugs-proteins interactions, and multiple kinds of drugs similarities at different levels, including target proteins of drugs, drug-related diseases, and side effects of drugs. We propose a network representation learning method based on matrix factorisation to learn low-dimensional vector
representations of drug and protein nodes. On the basis of these low-dimensional node representations, a GBDT-based prediction model was constructed and it obtains the association scores through establishing multiple decision trees for a drug-protein pairs. NGDTP is an ensemble learning model that
fully utilises all the negative samples to effectively alleviate the problem of class imbalance. NGDTP achieves superior prediction performance when it is compared with several state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results indicate that NGDTP also retrieves more actual drug-protein interactions

model's decisions based on the identification of the input regions that contributed the most to the prediction. We make use of an end-to-end deep learning architecture to predict binding affinity, where CNNs are exploited in their capacity to automatically identify and extract discriminating deep
