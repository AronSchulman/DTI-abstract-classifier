Drug Target Group Prediction with Multiple Drug Networks.,31267864,"Identification of drug-target interaction is essential in drug discovery. It is beneficial to predict unexpected therapeutic or adverse side effects of drugs. To date, several computational methods have been proposed to predict drug-target interactions because they are prompt and low-cost compared with traditional wet experiments. In this study, we investigated this problem in a different way. According to KEGG, drugs were classified into several groups based on their target proteins. A multi-label classification model was presented to assign drugs into correct target groups. To make full use of the known drug properties, five networks were constructed, each of which represented drug associations in one property. A powerful network embedding method, Mashup, was adopted to extract drug features from above-mentioned networks, based on which several machine learning algorithms, including RAndom k-labELsets (RAKEL) algorithm, Label Powerset (LP) algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were used to build the classification model. Tenfold cross-validation yielded the accuracy of 0.839, exact match of 0.816 and hamming loss of 0.037, indicating good performance of the model. The contribution of each network was also analyzed. Furthermore, the network model with multiple networks was found to be superior to the one with a single network and classic model, indicating the superiority of the proposed model.",0,"Drug Target Group Prediction with Multiple Drug Networks.

Multimodal contrastive representation learning for drug-target binding affinity prediction.,37952703,"In the biomedical field, the efficacy of most drugs is demonstrated by their interactions with targets, meanwhile, accurate prediction of the strength of drug-target binding is extremely important for drug development efforts. Traditional bioassay-based drug-target binding affinity (DTA) prediction methods cannot meet the needs of drug R&D in the era of big data. Recent years we have witnessed significant success on deep learning-based models for drug-target binding affinity prediction task. However, these models only considered a single modality of drug and target information, and some valuable information was not fully utilized. In fact, the information of different modalities of drug and target can complement each other, and more valuable information can be obtained by fusing the information of different modalities. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal information fusion model for DTA prediction that is called FMDTA, which fully considers drug/target information in both string and graph modalities and balances the feature representations of different modalities by a contrastive learning approach. In addition, we exploited the alignment information of drug atoms and target residues to capture the positional information of string patterns, which can extract more useful feature information in SMILES and target sequences. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that FMDTA outperforms the state-of-the-art model, demonstrating the feasibility and excellent feature capture capability of FMDTA.

Deciphering the pharmacological mechanisms of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi on oral leukoplakia by combining network pharmacology,35667260,"Oral leukoplakia (OLK), an uncharacterized pathological condition that occurs as a white patch in the oral mucosa, is the most common precancerous condition. Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (SBG) is a medicinal plant with a wide range of pharmacological effects. Increased evidence shows that SBG has potential therapeutic effects on OLK. However, the therapeutic mechanisms of SBG against OLK have not yet been completely elucidated. This study aimed to clarify the active components and multi-target mechanisms of SBG against OLK via network pharmacology, molecular docking and experimental evaluations. The active components and related targets of SBG were screened by the TCMSP database and Swiss Target Prediction database. Potential therapeutic targets of OLK were collected using the GeneCards and OMIM databases. Then, we established protein-protein interaction (PPI), compound-target-disease (C-T-D), and compound-target-pathway (C-T-P) networks by Cytoscape to identify the main components, core targets, and pharmacological pathways of SBG against OLK via applying data mining techniques and topological parameters. Metascape database was utilized for GO and KEGG pathway analysis. Molecular docking techniques were used to estimate the binding force between the components and the hub genes. Subsequently, a series of in vitro experiments, specifically CCK-8 assay, clone formation assay, wound healing assay, flow cytometry, RT-qPCR and western blotting were conducted for further verification. There were 25 active components and 31 related target genes in SBG against OLK. PPI analysis showed that Akt1, VEGFA, EGFR, HIF1A and PTGS2 shared the highest centrality among all target genes. KEGG pathway analysis found that PI3K-Akt signaling pathway may occupy core status in the anti-OLK system. Molecular docking results showed that the main active components of SBG had a strong binding affinity to the hub genes. In vitro experiments showed that the leading component baicalein may inhibit proliferation, block cells in the S phase, induce DOK cell apoptosis, and downregulate the mRNA expression of 5 hub genes by inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway activation. The most predominant component of SBG against OLK was baicalein and the key pathway was PI3K/Akt. The main components and hub genes had robust binding abilities.

Novel drug-target interactions via link prediction and network embedding.,35379165,"As many interactions between the chemical and genomic space remain undiscovered, computational methods able to identify potential drug-target interactions (DTIs) are employed to accelerate drug discovery and reduce the required cost.

Coumarins and Quinolones as Effective Multiple Targeted Agents Versus Covid-19: An In Silico Study.,33563156,"Background: The Covid-19 virus emerged a few months ago in China, and infections rapidly escalated into a pandemic. Objective: To date, there is no selective antiviral agent for the management of pathologies associated with covid-19 and the need for an effective agent against it is essential. Methods: In this work, two home-made databases from synthetic quinolines and coumarins were virtually docked against viral proteases (3CL and PL), human cell surface proteases (TMPRSS2 and furin) and spike proteins (S1 and S2). Chloroquine, a reference drug without a clear mechanism against coronavirus was also docked on mentioned targets and the binding affinities compared with title compounds. Results: The best compounds of synthetic coumarins and quinolines for each target were determined. All compounds against all targets showed binding affinity between -5.80 to -8.99 kcal/mol in comparison with the FDA-approved drug, Chloroquine, with binding affinity of -5.7 to -7.98 kcal/mol. Two compounds, quinoline-1 and coumarin-24, were found to be effective on three targets - S2, TMPRSS2 and furin - simultaneously, with good predicted affinity between -7.54 to -8.85 kcal/mol. In silico ADME studies also confirmed good oral absorption for them. Furthermore, PASS prediction was calculated and coumarin-24 had higher probable activity (Pa) than probable inactivity (Pi) with acceptable protease inhibitory as well as good antiviral activity against Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza. Conclusion: Quinoline-1 and Coumarin-24 have the potential to be used against Covid-19.

Fine-grained selective similarity integration for drug-target interaction prediction.,36907663,"The discovery of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a pivotal process in pharmaceutical development. Computational approaches are a promising and efficient alternative to tedious and costly wet-lab experiments for predicting novel DTIs from numerous candidates. Recently, with the availability of abundant heterogeneous biological information from diverse data sources, computational methods have been able to leverage multiple drug and target similarities to boost the performance of DTI prediction. Similarity integration is an effective and flexible strategy to extract crucial information across complementary similarity views, providing a compressed input for any similarity-based DTI prediction model. However, existing similarity integration methods filter and fuse similarities from a global perspective, neglecting the utility of similarity views for each drug and target. In this study, we propose a Fine-Grained Selective similarity integration approach, called FGS, which employs a local interaction consistency-based weight matrix to capture and exploit the importance of similarities at a finer granularity in both similarity selection and combination steps. We evaluate FGS on five DTI prediction datasets under various prediction settings. Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms similarity integration competitors with comparable computational costs, but also achieves better prediction performance than state-of-the-art DTI prediction approaches by collaborating with conventional base models.

Proteolytic cleavage of host proteins by the Group IV viral proteases of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and Zika virus.,30742841,"The alphaviral nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) cysteine proteases (EC 3.4.22.-) are essential for the proteolytic processing of the nonstructural (ns) polyprotein and are validated drug targets. A common secondary role of these proteases is to antagonize the effects of interferon (IFN). After delineating the cleavage site motif of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) nsP2 cysteine protease, we searched the human genome to identify host protein substrates. Here we identify a new host substrate of the VEEV nsP2 protease, human TRIM14, a component of the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) signalosome. Short stretches of homologous host-pathogen protein sequences (SSHHPS) are present in the nonstructural polyprotein and TRIM14. A 25-residue cyan-yellow fluorescent protein TRIM14 substrate was cleaved in vitro by the VEEV nsP2 protease and the cleavage site was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry. A TRIM14 cleavage product also was found in VEEV-infected cell lysates. At least ten other Group IV (+)ssRNA viral proteases have been shown to cleave host proteins involved in generating the innate immune responses against viruses, suggesting that the integration of these short host protein sequences into the viral protease cleavage sites may represent an embedded mechanism of IFN antagonism. This interference mechanism shows several parallels with those of CRISPR/Cas9 and RNAi/RISC, but with a protease recognizing a protein sequence common to both the host and pathogen. The short host sequences embedded within the viral genome appear to be analogous to the short phage sequences found in a host's CRISPR spacer sequences.

Proteolytic cleavage of these proteins suggests a possible link between the protease and the virus-induced phenotype of ZIKV. The algorithm may have value for selecting cell lines and animal models that recapitulate virus-induced phenotypes, predicting host-range and susceptibility, selecting oncolytic viruses, identifying biomarkers, and de-risking live virus vaccines.

Graph-sequence attention and transformer for predicting drug-target affinity.,36320763,"Drug-target binding affinity (DTA) prediction has drawn increasing interest due to its substantial position in the drug discovery process. The development of new drugs is costly, time-consuming, and often accompanied by safety issues. Drug repurposing can avoid the expensive and lengthy process of drug development by finding new uses for already approved drugs. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop effective computational methods to predict DTAs. The attention mechanisms allow the computational method to focus on the most relevant parts of the input and have been proven to be useful for various tasks. In this study, we proposed a novel model based on self-attention, called GSATDTA, to predict the binding affinity between drugs and targets. For the representation of drugs, we use Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRU) to extract the SMILES representation from SMILES sequences, and graph neural networks to extract the graph representation of the molecular graphs. Then we utilize an attention mechanism to fuse the two representations of the drug. For the target/protein, we utilized an efficient transformer to learn the representation of the protein, which can capture the long-distance relationships in the sequence of amino acids.

Drug-target binding affinity (DTA) prediction has drawn increasing interest due to its substantial position in the drug discovery process. The development of new drugs is costly, time-consuming, and often accompanied by safety issues. Drug repurposing can avoid the expensive and lengthy process of drug development by finding new uses for already approved drugs. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop effective computational methods to predict DTAs. The attention mechanisms allow the computational method to focus on the most relevant parts of the input and have been proven to be useful for various tasks. In this study, we proposed a novel model based on self-attention, called GSATDTA, to predict the binding affinity between drugs and targets. For the representation of drugs, we use Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRU) to extract the SMILES representation from SMILES sequences, and graph neural networks to extract the graph representation of the molecular graphs. Then we utilize an attention mechanism to fuse the two representations of the drug. For the target/protein, we utilized an efficient transformer to learn the representation of the protein, which can capture the long-distance relationships in the sequence of amino acids. We conduct extensive experiments to compare our model with state-of-the-art models.

Optimization of drug-target affinity prediction methods through feature processing schemes.,37812388,"Numerous high-accuracy drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction models, whose performance is heavily reliant on the drug and target feature information, are developed at the expense of complexity and interpretability.

In this study, to obtain a model with high accuracy and strong interpretability, we utilize various traditional and cutting-edge feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques to process self-associated features and adjacent associated features. These optimized features are then fed into learning to rank to achieve efficient DTA prediction. Extensive experimental results on two commonly used datasets indicate that, among various feature optimization methods, the regression tree-based feature selection method is most beneficial for constructing models with good performance and strong robustness.

Self-attention, on the other hand, is a relatively recent technique for capturing long-range interactions that has been used primarily in sequence modeling tasks. The results of comparative experiments show that CSatDTA surpasses previous sequence-based or other approaches and has outstanding retention abilities."
Link prediction in drug-target interactions network using similarity indices.,28095781,"In silico drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction plays an integral role in drug repositioning: the discovery of new uses for existing drugs. One popular method of drug repositioning is network-based DTI prediction, which uses complex network theory to predict DTIs from a drug-target network. Currently, most network-based DTI prediction is based on machine learning - methods such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) or Support Vector Machines (SVM). These methods require additional information about the characteristics of drugs, targets and DTIs, such as chemical structure, genome sequence, binding types, causes of interactions, etc., and do not perform satisfactorily when such information is unavailable. We propose a new, alternative method for DTI prediction that makes use of only network topology information attempting to solve this problem. We compare our method for DTI prediction against the well-known RBM approach. We show that when applied to the MATADOR database, our approach based on node neighborhoods yield higher precision for high-ranking predictions than RBM when no information regarding DTI types is available.

AttentionDTA: Drug-Target Binding Affinity Prediction by Sequence-Based Deep Learning With Attention Mechanism.,35471889,"The identification of drug-target relations (DTRs) is substantial in drug development. A large number of methods treat DTRs as drug-target interactions (DTIs), a binary classification problem. The main drawback of these methods are the lack of reliable negative samples and the absence of many important aspects of DTR, including their dose dependence and quantitative affinities. With increasing number of publications of drug-protein binding affinity data recently, DTRs prediction can be viewed as a regression problem of drug-target affinities (DTAs) which reflects how tightly the drug binds to the target and can present more detailed and specific information than DTIs. The growth of affinity data enables the use of deep learning architectures, which have been shown to be among the state-of-the-art methods in binding affinity prediction.

The aim of this study was to explore automated segmentation of ISHV as a potential surrogate for cerebrospinal fluid hemoglobin to predict SAH-SBI. Methods: This study is based on a retrospective analysis of imaging and clinical data from 220 consecutive patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage collected over a five-year period. 127 annotated initial non-contrast CT scans were used to train and test a convolutional neural network to automatically segment the ISHV in the remaining cohort. Performance was reported in terms of Dice score and intraclass correlation. We characterized the associations between ISHV and baseline cohort characteristics, SAH-SBI, ventriculoperitoneal shunt dependence, functional outcome, and survival. Established clinical (World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies, Hunt & Hess) and radiological (modified Fisher, Barrow Neurological Institute) scores served as references. Results: A strong volume agreement (0.73 Dice, range 0.43 - 0.93) and intraclass correlation (0.89, 95% CI, 0.81-0.94) were shown. While ISHV was not associated with the use of antithrombotics or cardiovascular risk factors, there was strong evidence for an association with a lower Glasgow Coma Scale at hospital admission. Aneurysm size and location were not associated with ISHV, but the presence of intracerebral or intraventricular hemorrhage were independently associated with higher ISHV. Despite strong evidence for a positive association between ISHV and SAH-SBI, the discriminatory ability of ISHV for SAH-SBI was insufficient. The discriminatory ability of ISHV was, however, higher regarding ventriculoperitoneal shunt dependence and functional outcome at three-months follow-up. Multivariate survival analysis provided strong evidence for an independent negative association between survival probability and both ISHV and intraventricular hemorrhage. Conclusions: The proposed algorithm demonstrates strong performance in volumetric segmentation of the ISHV on the admission CT.

Mining of Marburg Virus Proteome for Designing an Epitope-Based Vaccine.,35911751,"Marburg virus (MARV) is one of the most harmful zoonotic viruses with deadly effects on both humans and nonhuman primates.

However, up to date, there is no effective vaccine against MARV in the market. In the current study, the complete proteome of MARV (seven proteins) was analyzed for the antigenicity score and the virulence or physiological role of each protein where we nominated envelope glycoprotein (Gp), Transcriptional activator (VP30), and membrane-associated protein (VP24) as the candidates for epitope prediction. Following that, a vaccine construct was designed based on CTL, HTL, and BCL epitopes of the selected protein candidates and to finalize the vaccine construct, several amino acid linkers, β-defensin adjuvant, and PADRE peptides were incorporated. The generated potential vaccine was assessed computationally for several properties such as antigenicity, allergenicity, stability, and other structural features where the outcomes of these assessments nominated this potential vaccine to be validated for its binding affinity with two molecular targets TLR-8 and TLR-4. The binding score and the stability of the vaccine-receptor complex, which was deeply studied through molecular docking-coupled dynamics simulation, supported the selection of our designed vaccine as a putative solution for MARV that should be validated through future wet-lab experiments.

Identification of Potential Aldose Reductase Inhibitors Using Convolutional Neural Network-Based in Silico Screening.,37788831,"Aldose reductase (ALR2) is a notable enzyme of the polyol pathway responsible for aggravating diabetic neuropathy complications. The first step begins when it catalyzes the reduction of glucose to sorbitol with NADPH as a coenzyme. Elevated concentrations of sorbitol damage the tissues, leading to complications like neuropathy. Though considerable effort has been pushed toward the successful discovery of potent inhibitors, its discovery still remains an elusive task. To this end, we present a 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) based ALR2 inhibitor classification technique by dealing with snapshots of images captured from 3D chemical structures with multiple rotations as input data. The CNN-based architecture was trained on the 360 sets of image data along each axis and further prediction on the Maybridge library by each of the models. Subjecting the retrieved hits to molecular docking leads to the identification of the top 10 molecules with high binding affinity. The hits displayed a better blood-brain barrier penetration (BBB) score (90% with more than four scores) as compared to standard inhibitors (38%), reflecting the superior BBB penetrating efficiency of the hits. Followed by molecular docking, the biological evaluation spotlighted five compounds as promising ALR2 inhibitors and can be considered as a likely prospect for further structural optimization with medicinal chemistry efforts to improve their inhibition efficacy and consolidate them as new ALR2 antagonists in the future. In addition, the study also demonstrated the usefulness of scaffold analysis of the molecules as a method for investigating the significance of structurally diverse compounds in data-driven studies.

Decyl Gallate as a Possible Inhibitor of N-Glycosylation Process in Paracoccidioides lutzii.,31451502,"The available antifungal therapeutic arsenal is limited. The search for alternative drugs with fewer side effects and new targets remains a major challenge. Decyl gallate (G14) is a derivative of gallic acid with a range of biological activities and broad-spectrum antifungal activity. Previously, our group demonstrated the promising anti-Paracoccidioides activity of G14. In this work, to evaluate the antifungal characteristics of G14 for Paracoccidioides lutzii, a chemical-genetic interaction analysis was conducted on a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model. N-glycosylation and/or the unfolded protein response pathway was identified as a high-confidence process for drug target prediction. The overactivation of unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling was confirmed using this model with IRE1/ATF6/PERK genes tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP). In P. lutzii, this prediction was confirmed by the low activity of glycosylated enzymes [α-(1,3)-glucanase, N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAGase), and α-(1,4)-amylase], by hyperexpression of genes involved with the UPR and glycosylated enzymes, and by the reduction in the amounts of glycosylated proteins and chitin. All of these components are involved in fungal cell wall integrity and are dependent on the N-glycosylation process. This loss of integrity was confirmed by the reduction in mitochondrial activity, impaired budding, enhancement of wall permeability, and a decrease in viability. These events led to a reduction of the ability of fungi to adhere on human lung epithelial cells (A549) in vitro Therefore, G14 may have an important role in balancing the inflammatory reaction caused by fungal infection, without interfering with the microbicidal activity of nitric oxide.

Mutation effect estimation on protein-protein interactions using deep contextualized representation learning.,32166223,"The functional impact of protein mutations is reflected on the alteration of conformation and thermodynamics of protein-protein interactions (PPIs).

Nonetheless, such features require extensive human labors and expert knowledge to obtain, and have limited abilities to reflect point mutations. We present an end-to-end deep learning framework, MuPIPR (Mutation Effects in Protein-protein Interaction PRediction Using Contextualized Representations), to estimate the effects of mutations on PPIs.

Multi-layer perceptron regressors are applied to the protein pair representations to predict the quantifiable changes of PPI properties upon mutations. Experimental evaluations show that, with only sequence information, MuPIPR outperforms various state-of-the-art systems on estimating the changes of binding affinity for SKEMPI v1, and offers comparable performance on SKEMPI v2.

Computational models that estimate the interaction strength of new drug-target pairs have the potential to expedite drug repurposing. Several models have been proposed for this task. However, these models represent the drugs as strings, which is not a natural way to represent molecules.

Target-Mediated Brain Tissue Binding for Small Molecule Inhibitors of Heat Shock Protein 90.,33105895,"Drug distribution in the brain is generally associated with an affinity for fatty brain tissues and therefore known to be species- and concentration-independent.

Our results show that increasing the test item concentrations from 0.3 to 100 µM increased the unbound fraction 32-fold for the most potent molecules, with no change for the inactive one (1.1 fold change). Saturation of HSP90 led to normal concentration-independent brain tissue binding. In vivo pharmacokinetics performed in rats showed that the overall volume of distribution of compounds is correlated with their affinity for HSP90. The in vitro binding and in vivo pharmacokinetics (PK) performed in rats showed that small molecule HSP90 inhibitors followed the principle of target-mediated drug disposition.

Drug-target interaction prediction using semi-bipartite graph model and deep learning.,32631230,"Identifying drug-target interaction is a key element in drug discovery. In silico prediction of drug-target interaction can speed up the process of identifying unknown interactions between drugs and target proteins. In recent studies, handcrafted features, similarity metrics and machine learning methods have been proposed for predicting drug-target interactions. However, these methods cannot fully learn the underlying relations between drugs and targets. In this paper, we propose anew framework for drug-target interaction prediction that learns latent features from drug-target interaction network. We present a framework to utilize the network topology and identify interacting and non-interacting drug-target pairs. We model the problem as a semi-bipartite graph in which we are able to use drug-drug and protein-protein similarity in a drug-protein network. We have then used a graph labeling method for vertex ordering in our graph embedding process. Finally, we employed deep neural network to learn the complex pattern of interacting pairs from embedded graphs. We show our approach is able to learn sophisticated drug-target topological features and outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed learning model on semi-bipartite graph model, can integrate drug-drug and protein-protein similarities which are semantically different than drug-protein information in a drug-target interaction network.

Fibroblast Growth Factor 11 Enables Tumor Cell Immune Escape by Promoting T Cell Exhaustion and Predicts Poor Prognosis in Patients with Lung Adenocarcinoma.,37250453,"Fibroblast growth factor 11 (FGF11) accelerates tumor proliferation in a variety of cancer types. This study aimed to examine the link between FGF11 and the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. FGF11 was searched in the Tumor Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and ImmProt databases. The link between FGF11 and lung cancer clinical data was investigated using TCGA and Kaplan-Meier (KM)-plotter databases, and we developed a prediction model. Putative mechanisms of action were investigated using Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses. The GeneMANIA and STRING databases were used to search for genes that interact with FGF11, and the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) database was used to discover connections between FGF11 and immune cells, as well as any correlations with immune-related genes. We found that FGF11 expression was higher in the lung adenocarcinoma tissue than in the paracancerous tissue, and patients with high FGF11 expression had a lower overall survival, progression-free survival, and disease specific survival rate than those with low FGF11 expression. The expression of FGF11 was inversely linked to six types of infiltrating immune cells in the TIMER database and was associated with EGFR, VEGFA, BRAF, and MET expressions. The FGF11 gene is negatively correlated with the expression of most immune cells, mainly with various functional T cells including Th1, Th1-like, Treg, and Resting Treg characterization genes. These results indicate that FGF11 has the potential to be a new lung adenocarcinoma biomarker.

Moreover, FYN induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death as early as 6 h after treatment. In addition, FYN significantly induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and increased calreticulin expression. Metabolomics analysis showed the increase of ATP utilization (assessed by a significant increase of the AMP/ATP and ADP/ATP ratio, necessary for apoptosis induction) and decrease of polyamines (that reflects growth potential).

Mitigating cold-start problems in drug-target affinity prediction with interaction knowledge transferring.,35788823,"Predicting the drug-target interaction is crucial for drug discovery as well as drug repurposing. Machine learning is commonly used in drug-target affinity (DTA) problem.

Previous works try to solve the cold start problem by learning the drug or target representation using unsupervised learning. While the drug or target representation can be learned in an unsupervised manner, it still lacks the interaction information, which is critical in drug-target interaction. To incorporate the interaction information into the drug and protein interaction, we proposed using transfer learning from chemical-chemical interaction (CCI) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) task to drug-target interaction task.

Drug-Target Interaction Prediction Using Multi-Head Self-Attention and Graph Attention Network.,33956632,"Identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) is an important step in the process of new drug discovery and drug repositioning. Accurate predictions for DTIs can improve the efficiency in the drug discovery and development. Although rapid advances in deep learning technologies have generated various computational methods, it is still appealing to further investigate how to design efficient networks for predicting DTIs. In this study, we propose an end-to-end deep learning method (called MHSADTI) to predict DTIs based on the graph attention network and multi-head self-attention mechanism. First, the characteristics of drugs and proteins are extracted by the graph attention network and multi-head self-attention mechanism, respectively.

Finally, we predict DTIs by a fully connected layer after obtaining the feature vectors of drugs and proteins.

Designing optimized drug candidates with Generative Adversarial Network,35754029,"Drug design is an important area of study for pharmaceutical businesses. However, low efficacy, off-target delivery, time consumption, and high cost are challenges and can create barriers that impact this process. Deep Learning models are emerging as a promising solution to perform de novo drug design, i.e., to generate drug-like molecules tailored to specific needs. However, stereochemistry was not explicitly considered in the generated molecules, which is inevitable in targeted-oriented molecules. This paper proposes a framework based on Feedback Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that includes optimization strategy by incorporating Encoder-Decoder, GAN, and Predictor deep models interconnected with a feedback loop. The Encoder-Decoder converts the string notations of molecules into latent space vectors, effectively creating a new type of molecular representation. At the same time, the GAN can learn and replicate the training data distribution and, therefore, generate new compounds. The feedback loop is designed to incorporate and evaluate the generated molecules according to the multiobjective desired property at every epoch of training to ensure a steady shift of the generated distribution towards the space of the targeted properties. Moreover, to develop a more precise set of molecules, we also incorporate a multiobjective optimization selection technique based on a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can generate realistic, novel molecules that span the chemical space. The proposed Encoder-Decoder model correctly reconstructs 99% of the datasets, including stereochemical information.

The methodology is based on mining a heterogeneous graph that integrates drug-drug and protein-protein similarity networks, together with verified drug-disease and protein-disease associations. In order to extract appropriate features, the three-layer heterogeneous graph was mapped to low dimensional vectors using node embedding principles. The DTI prediction problem was formulated as a multi-label, multi-class classification task, aiming to determine drug modes of action. DTIs were defined by concatenating pairs of drug and target vectors extracted from graph embedding, which were used as input to classification via gradient boosted trees, where a model is trained to predict the type of interaction. After validating the prediction ability of DT2Vec+, a comprehensive analysis of all unknown DTIs was conducted to predict the degree and type of interaction.

Finding drugs that can interact with a specific target to induce a desired therapeutic outcome is key deliverable in drug discovery for targeted treatment. Therefore, both identifying new drug-target links, as well as delineating the type of drug interaction, are important in drug repurposing studies. A computational drug repurposing approach was proposed to predict novel drug-target interactions (DTIs), as well as to predict the type of interaction induced. The methodology is based on mining a heterogeneous graph that integrates drug-drug and protein-protein similarity networks, together with verified drug-disease and protein-disease associations. In order to extract appropriate features, the three-layer heterogeneous graph was mapped to low dimensional vectors using node embedding principles. The DTI prediction problem was formulated as a multi-label, multi-class classification task, aiming to determine drug modes of action. DTIs were defined by concatenating pairs of drug and target vectors extracted from graph embedding, which were used as input to classification via gradient boosted trees, where a model is trained to predict the type of interaction. After validating the prediction ability of DT2Vec+, a comprehensive analysis of all unknown DTIs was conducted to predict the degree and type of interaction. Finally, the model was applied to propose potential approved drugs to target cancer-specific biomarkers. DT2Vec+ showed promising results in predicting type of DTI, which was achieved via integrating and mapping triplet drug-target-disease association graphs into low-dimensional dense vectors.

DTiGEMS+,33431036,"In silico prediction of drug-target interactions is a critical phase in the sustainable drug development process, especially when the research focus is to capitalize on the repositioning of existing drugs. However, developing such computational methods is not an easy task, but is much needed, as current methods that predict potential drug-target interactions suffer from high false-positive rates. Here we introduce DTiGEMS+, a computational method that predicts Drug-Target interactions using Graph Embedding, graph Mining, and Similarity-based techniques. DTiGEMS+ combines similarity-based as well as feature-based approaches, and models the identification of novel drug-target interactions as a link prediction problem in a heterogeneous network. DTiGEMS+ constructs the heterogeneous network by augmenting the known drug-target interactions graph with two other complementary graphs namely: drug-drug similarity, target-target similarity. DTiGEMS+ combines different computational techniques to provide the final drug target prediction, these techniques include graph embeddings, graph mining, and machine learning. DTiGEMS+ integrates multiple drug-drug similarities and target-target similarities into the final heterogeneous graph construction after applying a similarity selection procedure as well as a similarity fusion algorithm. Using four benchmark datasets, we show DTiGEMS+ substantially improves prediction performance compared to other state-of-the-art in silico methods developed to predict of drug-target interactions by achieving the highest average AUPR across all datasets (0.92), which reduces the error rate by 33.3% relative to the second-best performing model in the state-of-the-art methods comparison.",0,"DTiGEMS+ In silico prediction of drug-target interactions is a critical phase in the sustainable drug development process, especially when the research focus is to capitalize on the repositioning of existing drugs.

Co-VAE: Drug-Target Binding Affinity Prediction by Co-Regularized Variational Autoencoders.,34652996,"Identifying drug-target interactions has been a key step in drug discovery. Many computational methods have been proposed to directly determine whether drugs and targets can interact or not. Drug-target binding affinity is another type of data which could show the strength of the binding interaction between a drug and a target. However, it is more challenging to predict drug-target binding affinity, and thus a very few studies follow this line. In our work, we propose a novel co-regularized variational autoencoders (Co-VAE) to predict drug-target binding affinity based on drug structures and target sequences. The Co-VAE model consists of two VAEs for generating drug SMILES strings and target sequences, respectively, and a co-regularization part for generating the binding affinities.

Identifying drug-target interactions has been a key step in drug discovery. Many computational methods have been proposed to directly determine whether drugs and targets can interact or not. Drug-target binding affinity is another type of data which could show the strength of the binding interaction between a drug and a target. However, it is more challenging to predict drug-target binding affinity, and thus a very few studies follow this line. In our work, we propose a novel co-regularized variational autoencoders (Co-VAE) to predict drug-target binding affinity based on drug structures and target sequences. The Co-VAE model consists of two VAEs for generating drug SMILES strings and target sequences, respectively, and a co-regularization part for generating the binding affinities. We theoretically prove that the Co-VAE model is to maximize the lower bound of the joint likelihood of drug, protein and their affinity.

Efficient function of signal peptidase 1 of Escherichia coli is partly determined by residues in the mature N-terminus of exported proteins.,30849301,"Exported proteins require an N-terminal signal peptide to direct them from the cytoplasm to the periplasm. Once the protein has been translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane, the signal peptide is cleaved by a signal peptidase, allowing the remainder of the protein to fold into its mature state in the periplasm. Signal peptidase I (LepB) cleaves non-lipoproteins and recognises the sequence Ala-X-Ala. Amino acids present at the N-terminus of mature, exported proteins have been shown to affect the efficiency at which the protein is exported. Here we investigated a bias against aromatic amino acids at the second position in the mature protein (P2'). Maltose binding protein (MBP) was mutated to introduce aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine) at P2'. All mutants with aromatic amino acids at P2' were exported less efficiently as indicated by a slight increase in precursor protein in vivo. Binding of LepB to peptides that encompass the MBP cleavage site were analysed using surface plasmon resonance. These studies showed peptides with an aromatic amino acid at P2' had a slower off rate, due to a significantly higher binding affinity for LepB. These data are consistent with the accumulation of small amounts of preMBP in purified protein samples. Hence, the reason for the lack of aromatic amino acids at P2' in E. coli is likely due to interference with efficient LepB activity. These data and previous bioinformatics strongly suggest that aromatic amino acids are not preferred at P2' and this should be incorporated into signal peptide prediction algorithms.",0,"Efficient function of signal peptidase 1 of Escherichia coli is partly determined by residues in the mature N-terminus of exported proteins.

Therefore, we propose a method based on heterogeneous graph convolutional neural network for drug-target interaction prediction, GCHN-DTI (Predicting drug-target interactions by graph convolution on heterogeneous net-works), to predict potential DTIs. GCHN-DTI integrates network information from drug-target interactions, drug-drug interactions, drug-similarities, target-target interactions, and target-similarities. Then, the graph convolution operation is used in the heterogeneous network to obtain the node embedding of the drugs and the targets. Furthermore, we incorporate an attention mechanism between graph convolutional layers to combine node embedding from each layer. Finally, the drug-target interaction score is predicted based on the node embedding of the drugs and the targets. Our model uses fewer network types and achieves higher prediction performance.

Identification of a minimum number of genes to predict triple-negative breast cancer subgroups from gene expression profiles.,36536459,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a very heterogeneous disease. Several gene expression and mutation profiling approaches were used to classify it, and all converged to the identification of distinct molecular subtypes, with some overlapping across different approaches. However, a standardised tool to routinely classify TNBC in the clinics and guide personalised treatment is lacking. We aimed at defining a specific gene signature for each of the six TNBC subtypes proposed by Lehman et al. in 2011 (basal-like 1 (BL1); basal-like 2 (BL2); mesenchymal (M); immunomodulatory (IM); mesenchymal stem-like (MSL); and luminal androgen receptor (LAR)), to be able to accurately predict them. Lehman's TNBCtype subtyping tool was applied to RNA-sequencing data from 482 TNBC (GSE164458), and a minimal subtype-specific gene signature was defined by combining two class comparison techniques with seven attribute selection methods. Several machine learning algorithms for subtype prediction were used, and the best classifier was applied on microarray data from 72 Italian TNBC and on the TNBC subset of the BRCA-TCGA data set. We identified two signatures with the 120 and 81 top up- and downregulated genes that define the six TNBC subtypes, with prediction accuracy ranging from 88.6 to 89.4%, and even improving after removal of the least important genes.

However, the therapeutic effects of HQJXCHP against peritoneal fibrosis (PF) and potential targets are currently unclear. Aims of the study: The main objective of this study was preliminary prediction and validation of the effects and molecular mechanisms of action of HQJXCHP against PF based on network pharmacology analysis and experimental verification. Materials and methods: The ingredients of HQJXCHP were analyzed via HPLC-Q-TOF/MS. Bioactive compounds of HQJXCHP used for network pharmacology analysis were obtained from the TCMSP database. HQJXCHP-related therapeutic targets in PF were obtained from the GeneCards, OMIM, Therapeutic Targets and PharmGkb databases.

The targets of HQJXCHO were further validated in a PDS-induced PF mouse model in vivo and PMCs MMT model in vitro. Results: A total of 23 bioactive compounds of HQJXCHP related 188 target genes were retrieved. The HQJXCHP compound-target and PF-related target networks identified 131 common target genes.

Methods: A systematic network pharmacology analysis was conducted by integrating construction of SZC compound database and AM target database, prediction of potential active compounds and targets by molecular docking combined with compound-target prediction graph (CTPG), protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Then, the anti-inflammation experiments in vitro were performed by investigating SZC and the representative compounds regulating nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10). Results: Our findings show that SZC mainly treated AM by stimulating 28 core targets through 30 key potential active compounds, and affecting 4 crucial pathways. The treatment was associated with inflammation reaction, hormone regulation, cell adhesion, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Additionally, SZC achieved the anti-inflammatory activity by the cooperation of the compounds through inhibiting NO and IL-6, both promoting and inhibiting IL-10. Conclusion: This study investigated the anti-inflammatory activity of SZC based on a systematic analysis of SZC remedying AM, which was revealed to be one of the essential mechanisms. These findings will provide valuable guidance for further research of the SZC treatment of AM, and help improve the comprehension of SZC pharmacological basis as well as AM pathogenesis."
Multiple similarity drug-target interaction prediction with random walks and matrix factorization.,36070659,"The discovery of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a very promising area of research with great potential. The accurate identification of reliable interactions among drugs and proteins via computational methods, which typically leverage heterogeneous information retrieved from diverse data sources, can boost the development of effective pharmaceuticals. Although random walk and matrix factorization techniques are widely used in DTI prediction, they have several limitations. Random walk-based embedding generation is usually conducted in an unsupervised manner, while the linear similarity combination in matrix factorization distorts individual insights offered by different views. To tackle these issues, we take a multi-layered network approach to handle diverse drug and target similarities, and propose a novel optimization framework, called Multiple similarity DeepWalk-based Matrix Factorization (MDMF), for DTI prediction. The framework unifies embedding generation and interaction prediction, learning vector representations of drugs and targets that not only retain higher order proximity across all hyper-layers and layer-specific local invariance, but also approximate the interactions with their inner product. Furthermore, we develop an ensemble method (MDMF2A) that integrates two instantiations of the MDMF model, optimizing the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), respectively. The empirical study on real-world DTI datasets shows that our method achieves statistically significant improvement over current state-of-the-art approaches in four different settings. Moreover, the validation of highly ranked non-interacting pairs also demonstrates the potential of MDMF2A to discover novel DTIs.",0,"Multiple similarity drug-target interaction prediction with random walks and matrix factorization.

Epigenetic differences in monozygotic twins discordant for major depressive disorder.,27300265,"Although monozygotic (MZ) twins share the majority of their genetic makeup, they can be phenotypically discordant on several traits and diseases. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that can be influenced by genetic, environmental and stochastic events and may have an important impact on individual variability.

Predicting affinity through homology (PATH): interpretable binding affinity prediction with persistent homology,38014181,"Accurate binding affinity prediction is crucial to structure-based drug design. Recent work used computational topology to obtain an effective representation of protein-ligand interactions.

In this work, we propose a novel, interpretable algorithm for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. Our algorithm achieves interpretability through an effective embedding of distances across bipartite matchings of the protein and ligand atoms into real-valued functions by summing Gaussians centered at features constructed by persistent homology.

A deep learning framework for high-throughput mechanism-driven phenotype compound screening.,32743586,"Target-based high-throughput compound screening dominates conventional one-drug-one-gene drug discovery process.

Several methods have been proposed to impute missing values for gene expression datasets. However, few existing methods can perform de novo chemical compound screening. In this study, we propose a mechanism-driven neural network-based method named DeepCE (Deep Chemical Expression) which utilizes graph convolutional neural network to learn chemical representation and multi-head attention mechanism to model chemical substructure-gene and gene-gene feature associations. In addition, we propose a novel data augmentation method which extracts useful information from unreliable experiments in L1000 dataset.
