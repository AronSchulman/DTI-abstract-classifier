Matrix factorization with denoising autoencoders for prediction of drug-target interactions.,35871213,"Drug-target interaction is crucial in the discovery of new drugs. Computational methods can be used to identify new drug-target interactions at low costs and with reasonable accuracy. Recent studies pay more attention to machine-learning methods, ranging from matrix factorization to deep learning, in the DTI prediction. Since the interaction matrix is often extremely sparse, DTI prediction performance is significantly decreased with matrix factorization-based methods. Therefore, some matrix factorization methods utilize side information to address both the sparsity issue of the interaction matrix and the cold-start issue. By combining matrix factorization and autoencoders, we propose a hybrid DTI prediction model that simultaneously learn the hidden factors of drugs and targets from their side information and interaction matrix. The proposed method is composed of two steps: the pre-processing of the interaction matrix, and the hybrid model. We leverage the similarity matrices of both drugs and targets to address the sparsity problem of the interaction matrix. The comparison of our approach against other algorithms on the same reference datasets has shown good results regarding area under receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under precision-recall curve. More specifically, experimental results achieve high accuracy on golden standard datasets (e.g., Nuclear Receptors, GPCRs, Ion Channels, and Enzymes) when performed with five repetitions of tenfold cross-validation.

PPDTS: Predicting potential drug-target interactions based on network similarity.,34783172,"Identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) has great practical importance in the drug discovery process for known diseases. However, only a small proportion of DTIs in these databases has been verified experimentally, and the computational methods for predicting the interactions remain challenging. As a result, some effective computational models have become increasingly popular for predicting DTIs. In this work, the authors predict potential DTIs from the local structure of drug-target associations' network, which is different from the traditional global network similarity methods based on structure and ligand. A novel method called PPDTS is proposed to predict DTIs. First, according to the DTIs' network local structure, the known DTIs are converted into a binary network. Second, the Resource Allocation algorithm is used to obtain a drug-drug similarity network and a target-target similarity network. Third, a Collaborative Filtering algorithm is used with the known drug-target topology information to obtain similarity scores. Fourth, the linear combination of drug-target similarity model and the target-drug similarity model are innovatively proposed to obtain the final prediction results. Finally, the experimental performance of PPDTS has proved to be higher than that of the previously mentioned four popular network-based similarity methods, which is validated in different experimental datasets.

Identifying potential drug-target interactions based on ensemble deep learning.,37396659,"Drug-target interaction prediction is one important step in drug research and development. Experimental methods are time consuming and laborious. In this study, we developed a novel DTI prediction method called EnGDD by combining initial feature acquisition, dimensional reduction, and DTI classification based on Gradient boosting neural network, Deep neural network, and Deep Forest. EnGDD was compared with seven stat-of-the-art DTI prediction methods (BLM-NII, NRLMF, WNNGIP, NEDTP, DTi2Vec, RoFDT, and MolTrans) on the nuclear receptor, GPCR, ion channel, and enzyme datasets under cross validations on drugs, targets, and drug-target pairs, respectively. EnGDD computed the best recall, accuracy, F1-score, AUC, and AUPR under the majority of conditions, demonstrating its powerful DTI identification performance. EnGDD predicted that D00182 and hsa2099, D07871 and hsa1813, DB00599 and hsa2562, D00002 and hsa10935 have a higher interaction probabilities among unknown drug-target pairs and may be potential DTIs on the four datasets, respectively. In particular, D00002 (Nadide) was identified to interact with hsa10935 (Mitochondrial peroxiredoxin3) whose up-regulation might be used to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, EnGDD was used to find possible drug targets for Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease after confirming its DTI identification performance. The results show that D01277, D04641, and D08969 may be applied to the treatment of Parkinson's disease through targeting hsa1813 (dopamine receptor D2) and D02173, D02558, and D03822 may be the clues of treatment for patients with Alzheimer's disease through targeting hsa5743 (prostaglandinendoperoxide synthase 2).

Mitigating cold-start problems in drug-target affinity prediction with interaction knowledge transferring.,35788823,"Predicting the drug-target interaction is crucial for drug discovery as well as drug repurposing. Machine learning is commonly used in drug-target affinity (DTA) problem. However, the machine learning model faces the cold-start problem where the model performance drops when predicting the interaction of a novel drug or target. Previous works try to solve the cold start problem by learning the drug or target representation using unsupervised learning. While the drug or target representation can be learned in an unsupervised manner, it still lacks the interaction information, which is critical in drug-target interaction. To incorporate the interaction information into the drug and protein interaction, we proposed using transfer learning from chemical-chemical interaction (CCI) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) task to drug-target interaction task. The representation learned by CCI and PPI tasks can be transferred smoothly to the DTA task due to the similar nature of the tasks.

DEDTI versus IEDTI: efficient and predictive models of drug-target interactions.,37286613,"Drug repurposing is an active area of research that aims to decrease the cost and time of drug development.

AttentionDTA: Drug-Target Binding Affinity Prediction by Sequence-Based Deep Learning With Attention Mechanism.,35471889,"The identification of drug-target relations (DTRs) is substantial in drug development. A large number of methods treat DTRs as drug-target interactions (DTIs), a binary classification problem. The main drawback of these methods are the lack of reliable negative samples and the absence of many important aspects of DTR, including their dose dependence and quantitative affinities. With increasing number of publications of drug-protein binding affinity data recently, DTRs prediction can be viewed as a regression problem of drug-target affinities (DTAs) which reflects how tightly the drug binds to the target and can present more detailed and specific information than DTIs. The growth of affinity data enables the use of deep learning architectures, which have been shown to be among the state-of-the-art methods in binding affinity prediction. Although relatively effective, due to the black-box nature of deep learning, these models are less biologically interpretable. In this study, we proposed a deep learning-based model, named AttentionDTA, which uses attention mechanism to predict DTAs. Different from the models using 3D structures of drug-target complexes or graph representation of drugs and proteins, the novelty of our work is to use attention mechanism to focus on key subsequences which are important in drug and protein sequences when predicting its affinity. We use two separate one-dimensional Convolution Neural Networks (1D-CNNs) to extract the semantic information of drug's SMILES string and protein's amino acid sequence. Furthermore, a two-side multi-head attention mechanism is developed and embedded to our model to explore the relationship between drug features and protein features. We evaluate our model on three established DTA benchmark datasets, Davis, Metz, and KIBA. AttentionDTA outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning methods under different evaluation metrics.

Co-VAE: Drug-Target Binding Affinity Prediction by Co-Regularized Variational Autoencoders.,34652996,"Identifying drug-target interactions has been a key step in drug discovery.

Related parameters of affinity and stability prediction of HLA-A*2402 restricted antigen peptides based on molecular docking.,33987371,"Background: Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) plays an important role in cell immune response, and stable interaction between polypeptides and MHC-I ensures efficient presentation of polypeptide-MHC-I (pMHC-I) molecular complexes to T cells. The aim of this study was to explore ways to improve the affinity and stability of the p-Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-A*2402 complex. Methods: The peptide sequences of the restricted antigen peptides for HLA-A*2402 and the results of the in vitro competitive binding test were retrieved from the literature. The affinity values were predicted using NetMHCpan v4.1 server, and the stability values were predicted using the NetMHCstab v1.0 server. Auto Vina was used to dock peptides to HLA-A*2402 protein in a flexible docking manner, while Flexpepdock was employed to optimize the docking morphology. Maestro was used to analyze the intermolecular forces and the binding affinity of the complex, while MM-GBSA was used to calculate the binding free energy values. Results: The intermolecular interactions that maintained the affinity and stability of peptide-HLA-A*2402 complex relied mainly on HB, followed by pi stack. The binding affinity values of molecular docking were associated with the predicted values of affinity and stability, the binding affinity and the binding free energy, as well as the intermolecular force pi-stack.

In addition, several signaling pathways, including TNF, toll-like receptor, mitogen-activated protein kinases, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors, were identified as key regulators in the mediation of CBD's anti-inflammatory activity. Conclusion: A network-based pharmacology analysis identified potential molecular targets and signaling pathways for CBD's anti-inflammatory activity. Findings from this study add to the growing body of data supporting the utilization of CBD as a promising anti-inflammatory natural product."
Drug-target interactions prediction using marginalized denoising model on heterogeneous networks.,32703151,"Drugs achieve pharmacological functions by acting on target proteins. Identifying interactions between drugs and target proteins is an essential task in old drug repositioning and new drug discovery.

Compared with the wet-lab experiments, the computational approaches have lower cost for drug discovery and provides effective guidance in the subsequent experimental verification. How to integrate different types of biological data and handle the sparsity of drug-target interaction data are still great challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel drug-target interactions (DTIs) prediction method incorporating marginalized denoising model on heterogeneous networks with association index kernel matrix and latent global association. The experimental results on benchmark datasets and new compiled datasets indicate that compared to other existing methods, our method achieves higher scores of AUC (area under curve of receiver operating characteristic) and larger values of AUPR (area under precision-recall curve). The performance improvement in our method depends on the association index kernel matrix and the latent global association.

Ginger components as new leads for the design and development of novel multi-targeted anti-Alzheimer's drugs: a computational investigation.,25364231,"Ginger (Zingiber officinale), despite being a common dietary adjunct that contributes to the taste and flavor of foods, is well known to contain a number of potentially bioactive phytochemicals having valuable medicinal properties. Although recent studies have emphasized their benefits in Alzheimer's disease, limited information is available on the possible mechanism by which it renders anti-Alzheimer activity. Therefore, the present study seeks to employ molecular docking studies to investigate the binding interactions between active ginger components and various anti-Alzheimer drug targets. Lamarckian genetic algorithm methodology was employed for docking of 12 ligands with 13 different target proteins using AutoDock 4.2 program. Docking protocol was validated by re-docking of all native co-crystallized ligands into their original binding cavities exhibiting a strong correlation coefficient value (r (2)=0.931) between experimentally reported and docking predicted activities. This value suggests that the approach could be a promising computational tool to aid optimization of lead compounds obtained from ginger. Analysis of binding energy, predicted inhibition constant, and hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions of ligands with target receptors revealed acetylcholinesterase as most promising, while c-Jun N-terminal kinase was recognized as the least favorable anti-Alzheimer's drug target. Common structural requirements include hydrogen bond donor/acceptor area, hydrophobic domain, carbon spacer, and distal hydrophobic domain flanked by hydrogen bond donor/acceptor moieties. In addition, drug-likeness score and molecular properties responsible for a good pharmacokinetic profile were calculated by Osiris property explorer and Molinspiration online toolkit, respectively.

Modeling receptor flexibility in the structure-based design of KRASG12C inhibitors.,35930206,"KRAS has long been referred to as an 'undruggable' target due to its high affinity for its cognate ligands (GDP and GTP) and its lack of readily exploited allosteric binding pockets. Recent progress in the development of covalent inhibitors of KRASG12C has revealed that occupancy of an allosteric binding site located between the α3-helix and switch-II loop of KRASG12C-sometimes referred to as the 'switch-II pocket'-holds great potential in the design of direct inhibitors of KRASG12C. In studying diverse switch-II pocket binders during the development of sotorasib (AMG 510), the first FDA-approved inhibitor of KRASG12C, we found the dramatic conformational flexibility of the switch-II pocket posing significant challenges toward the structure-based design of inhibitors. Here, we present our computational approaches for dealing with receptor flexibility in the prediction of ligand binding pose and binding affinity. For binding pose prediction, we modified the covalent docking program CovDock to allow for protein conformational mobility. This new docking approach, termed as FlexCovDock, improves success rates from 55 to 89% for binding pose prediction on a dataset of 10 cross-docking cases and has been prospectively validated across diverse ligand chemotypes. For binding affinity prediction, we found standard free energy perturbation (FEP) methods could not adequately handle the significant conformational change of the switch-II loop. We developed a new computational strategy to accelerate conformational transitions through the use of targeted protein mutations. Using this methodology, the mean unsigned error (MUE) of binding affinity prediction were reduced from 1.44 to 0.89 kcal/mol on a set of 14 compounds. These approaches were of significant use in facilitating the structure-based design of KRASG12C inhibitors and are anticipated to be of further use in the design of covalent (and noncovalent) inhibitors of other conformationally labile protein targets.",1,"Modeling receptor flexibility in the structure-based design of KRASG12C inhibitors.

SAM-DTA: a sequence-agnostic model for drug-target binding affinity prediction.,36545795,"Drug-target binding affinity prediction is a fundamental task for drug discovery and has been studied for decades. Most methods follow the canonical paradigm that processes the inputs of the protein (target) and the ligand (drug) separately and then combines them together. In this study we demonstrate, surprisingly, that a model is able to achieve even superior performance without access to any protein-sequence-related information.

Predicting Drug-Target Affinity by Learning Protein Knowledge From Biological Networks.,37018115,"Predicting drug-target affinity (DTA) is a crucial step in the process of drug discovery. Efficient and accurate prediction of DTA would greatly reduce the time and economic cost of new drug development, which has encouraged the emergence of a large number of deep learning-based DTA prediction methods. In terms of the representation of target proteins, current methods can be classified into 1D sequence- and 2D-protein graph-based methods. However, both two approaches focused only on the inherent properties of the target protein, but neglected the broad prior knowledge regarding protein interactions that have been clearly elucidated in past decades. Aiming at the above issue, this work presents an end-to-end DTA prediction method named MSF-DTA (Multi-Source Feature Fusion-based Drug-Target Affinity). The contributions can be summarized as follows. First, MSF-DTA adopts a novel ""neighboring feature""-based protein representation. Instead of utilizing only the inherent features of a target protein, MSF-DTA gathers additional information for the target protein from its biologically related ""neighboring"" proteins in PPI (i.e., protein-protein interaction) and SSN (i.e., sequence similarity) networks to get prior knowledge. Second, the representation was learned using an advanced graph pre-training framework, VGAE, which could not only gather node features but also learn topological connections, therefore contributing to a richer protein representation and benefiting the downstream DTA prediction task.

Uncovering New Drug Properties in Target-Based Drug-Drug Similarity Networks.,32947845,"Despite recent advances in bioinformatics, systems biology, and machine learning, the accurate prediction of drug properties remains an open problem.

Consequently, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised machine learning approach that uses the information we know about drug-target interactions to infer drug properties. To this end, we define drug similarity based on drug-target interactions and build a weighted Drug-Drug Similarity Network according to the drug-drug similarity relationships.

The resources required to test all these repurposing hints are considerable. Therefore we introduce a mechanism of prioritization based on the betweenness/degree node centrality.

Deciphering the pharmacological mechanisms of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi on oral leukoplakia by combining network pharmacology,35667260,"Oral leukoplakia (OLK), an uncharacterized pathological condition that occurs as a white patch in the oral mucosa, is the most common precancerous condition. Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (SBG) is a medicinal plant with a wide range of pharmacological effects. Increased evidence shows that SBG has potential therapeutic effects on OLK. However, the therapeutic mechanisms of SBG against OLK have not yet been completely elucidated. This study aimed to clarify the active components and multi-target mechanisms of SBG against OLK via network pharmacology, molecular docking and experimental evaluations. The active components and related targets of SBG were screened by the TCMSP database and Swiss Target Prediction database. Potential therapeutic targets of OLK were collected using the GeneCards and OMIM databases. Then, we established protein-protein interaction (PPI), compound-target-disease (C-T-D), and compound-target-pathway (C-T-P) networks by Cytoscape to identify the main components, core targets, and pharmacological pathways of SBG against OLK via applying data mining techniques and topological parameters. Metascape database was utilized for GO and KEGG pathway analysis. Molecular docking techniques were used to estimate the binding force between the components and the hub genes.

Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (SBG) is a medicinal plant with a wide range of pharmacological effects. Increased evidence shows that SBG has potential therapeutic effects on OLK. However, the therapeutic mechanisms of SBG against OLK have not yet been completely elucidated. This study aimed to clarify the active components and multi-target mechanisms of SBG against OLK via network pharmacology, molecular docking and experimental evaluations. The active components and related targets of SBG were screened by the TCMSP database and Swiss Target Prediction database. Potential therapeutic targets of OLK were collected using the GeneCards and OMIM databases. Then, we established protein-protein interaction (PPI), compound-target-disease (C-T-D), and compound-target-pathway (C-T-P) networks by Cytoscape to identify the main components, core targets, and pharmacological pathways of SBG against OLK via applying data mining techniques and topological parameters.

In this study, multiple chem-informatics approaches, including descriptor-based screening, 2D-similarity searching, and pharmacophore modelling were applied to screen new TNF-α inhibitors. Subsequently, multiple-docking protocols were used, and four-fold post-docking results were analyzed by consensus approach.

Here, we utilize one such network propagation-based approach, DTINet, which starts with diffusion component analysis of networks of both potential drug targets and diseases. Then an inductive matrix completion algorithm is applied to identify novel disease targets based on their network topological similarities with known disease targets with successfully launched drugs.

Network Pharmacology-Based Approach to Investigate the Molecular Targets of Rhubarb for Treating Cancer.,34211578,"Background: As a traditional Chinese medicine, rhubarb (also named Dahuang) is used to treat various diseases. Objective: To explore the possible antitumor mechanism of rhubarb by using network pharmacology and molecular docking in this study. Methods: Bioactive ingredients and related targets of rhubarb were obtained from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database. And the gene names corresponding to the proteins were found in the UniProt database. Then, the tumor-related targets were screened out from GeneCards and OMIM databases. Key antitumor targets of rhubarb were acquired by overlapping the above targets via the Venn diagram. The antitumor targets network of rhubarb active components was constructed by using Cytoscape 3.6.0 software. The protein interactions network was constructed using the STRING database. The GO and KEGG pathways involved in the targets were analyzed by using the DAVID database. Autodock Vina software was used to verify the molecular docking of rhubarb components and key targets. Results: Through screening and analysis, 10 active ingredients and 58 antitumor prediction targets were obtained and constructed a compound-target network. The targets such as CASP3, JUN, MYC, TNF, and PTGS2 may play a crucial role. These targets are involved in cancer pathway, calcium signaling pathway, cell apoptosis, small-cell lung cancer pathway, p53 signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway. The docking results indicated that the rhein binding with the CASP3 showed the highest binding energy.

Multipose binding in molecular docking.,24534807,"Molecular docking has been extensively applied in virtual screening of small molecule libraries for lead identification and optimization. A necessary prerequisite for successful differentiation between active and non-active ligands is the accurate prediction of their binding affinities in the complex by use of docking scoring functions. However, many studies have shown rather poor correlations between docking scores and experimental binding affinities. Our work aimed to improve this correlation by implementing a multipose binding concept in the docking scoring scheme. Multipose binding, i.e., the property of certain protein-ligand complexes to exhibit different ligand binding modes, has been shown to occur in nature for a variety of molecules. We conducted a high-throughput docking study and implemented multipose binding in the scoring procedure by considering multiple docking solutions in binding affinity prediction. In general, improvement of the agreement between docking scores and experimental data was observed, and this was most pronounced in complexes with large and flexible ligands and high binding affinities.

RLDOCK: A New Method for Predicting RNA-Ligand Interactions.,33095555,"The ability to accurately predict the binding site, binding pose, and binding affinity for ligand-RNA binding is important for RNA-targeted drug design. Here, we describe a new computational method, RLDOCK, for predicting the binding site and binding pose for ligand-RNA binding. By developing an energy-based scoring function, we sample exhaustively all of the possible binding sites with flexible ligand conformations for a ligand-RNA pair based on the geometric and energetic scores. The model distinguishes from other approaches in three notable features. First, the model enables exhaustive scanning of all of the possible binding sites, including multiple alternative or coexisting binding sites, for a given ligand-RNA pair. Second, the model is based on a new energy-based scoring function developed here. Third, the model employs a novel multistep screening algorithm to improve computational efficiency. Specifically, first, for each binding site, we use a gird-based energy map to rank the binding sites according to the minimum Lennard-Jones potential energy for the different ligand poses. Second, for a given selected binding site, we predict the ligand pose using a two-step algorithm. In the first step, we quickly identify the probable ligand poses using a coarse-grained simplified energy function. In the second step, for each of the probable ligand poses, we predict the ligand poses using a refined energy function.

BiComp-DTA: Drug-target binding affinity prediction through complementary biological-related and compression-based featurization approach.,37000857,"Drug-target binding affinity prediction plays a key role in the early stage of drug discovery. Numerous experimental and data-driven approaches have been developed for predicting drug-target binding affinity. However, experimental methods highly rely on the limited structural-related information from drug-target pairs, domain knowledge, and time-consuming assays. On the other hand, learning-based methods have shown an acceptable prediction performance. However, most of them utilize several simple and complex types of proteins and drug compounds data, ranging from the protein sequences to the topology of a graph representation of drug compounds, employing multiple deep neural networks for encoding and feature extraction, and so, leads to the computational overheads. In this study, we propose a unified measure for protein sequence encoding, named BiComp, which provides compression-based and evolutionary-related features from the protein sequences. Specifically, we employ Normalized Compression Distance and Smith-Waterman measures for capturing complementary information from the algorithmic information theory and biological domains, respectively. We utilize the proposed measure to encode the input proteins feeding a new deep neural network-based method for drug-target binding affinity prediction, named BiComp-DTA. BiComp-DTA is evaluated utilizing four benchmark datasets for drug-target binding affinity prediction. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, which employ complex models for protein encoding and feature extraction, BiComp-DTA provides superior efficiency in terms of accuracy, runtime, and the number of trainable parameters. The latter achievement facilitates execution of BiComp-DTA on a normal desktop computer in a fast fashion. As a comparative study, we evaluate BiComp's efficiency against its components for drug-target binding affinity prediction. The results have shown superior accuracy of BiComp due to the orthogonality and complementary nature of Smith-Waterman and Normalized Compression Distance measures for protein sequences. Such a protein sequence encoding provides efficient representation with no need for multiple sources of information, deep domain knowledge, and complex neural networks.",0,"BiComp-DTA: Drug-target binding affinity prediction through complementary biological-related and compression-based featurization approach. Drug-target binding affinity prediction plays a key role in the early stage of drug discovery. Numerous experimental and data-driven approaches have been developed for predicting drug-target binding affinity. However, experimental methods highly rely on the limited structural-related information from drug-target pairs, domain knowledge, and time-consuming assays. On the other hand, learning-based methods have shown an acceptable prediction performance. However, most of them utilize several simple and complex types of proteins and drug compounds data, ranging from the protein sequences to the topology of a graph representation of drug compounds, employing multiple deep neural networks for encoding and feature extraction, and so, leads to the computational overheads. In this study, we propose a unified measure for protein sequence encoding, named BiComp, which provides compression-based and evolutionary-related features from the protein sequences. Specifically, we employ Normalized Compression Distance and Smith-Waterman measures for capturing complementary information from the algorithmic information theory and biological domains, respectively.
