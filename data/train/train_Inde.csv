GCHN-DTI: Predicting drug-target interactions by graph convolution on heterogeneous networks.,36058415,"Determining the interaction of drug and target plays a key role in the process of drug development and discovery. The calculation methods can predict new interactions and speed up the process of drug development. In recent studies, the network-based approaches have been proposed to predict drug-target interactions. However, these methods cannot fully utilize the node information from heterogeneous networks. Therefore, we propose a method based on heterogeneous graph convolutional neural network for drug-target interaction prediction, GCHN-DTI (Predicting drug-target interactions by graph convolution on heterogeneous net-works), to predict potential DTIs. GCHN-DTI integrates network information from drug-target interactions, drug-drug interactions, drug-similarities, target-target interactions, and target-similarities. Then, the graph convolution operation is used in the heterogeneous network to obtain the node embedding of the drugs and the targets. Furthermore, we incorporate an attention mechanism between graph convolutional layers to combine node embedding from each layer. Finally, the drug-target interaction score is predicted based on the node embedding of the drugs and the targets. Our model uses fewer network types and achieves higher prediction performance. In addition, the prediction performance of the model will be significantly improved on the dataset with a higher proportion of positive samples. The experimental evaluations show that GCHN-DTI outperforms several state-of-the-art prediction methods.",0,"GCHN-DTI: Predicting drug-target interactions by graph convolution on heterogeneous networks.

ISLAND: in-silico proteins binding affinity prediction using sequence information.,33292419,"Background: Determining binding affinity in protein-protein interactions is important in the discovery and design of novel therapeutics and mutagenesis studies. Determination of binding affinity of proteins in the formation of protein complexes requires sophisticated, expensive and time-consuming experimentation which can be replaced with computational methods. Most computational prediction techniques require protein structures that limit their applicability to protein complexes with known structures. In this work, we explore sequence-based protein binding affinity prediction using machine learning. Method: We have used protein sequence information instead of protein structures along with machine learning techniques to accurately predict the protein binding affinity. Results: We present our findings that the true generalization performance of even the state-of-the-art sequence-only predictor is far from satisfactory and that the development of machine learning methods for binding affinity prediction with improved generalization performance is still an open problem. We have also proposed a sequence-based novel protein binding affinity predictor called ISLAND which gives better accuracy than existing methods over the same validation set as well as on external independent test dataset.

Mass spectrometry and affinity capillary electrophoresis for characterization of host-guest interactions.,30686647,"Affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE) in a free solution must be used to confirm the molecular interaction observed in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) for affinity binding analysis in the drug discovery process. In this article, the affinity of ibuprofen with three cyclodextrin species of different cavity sizes is investigated by both ESI-MS and ACE methods. Because the binding interactions are measured in different environments using ESI-MS (gas phase) and ACE (liquid phase), the experimental results show significant differences. To better illustrate the major factors influencing the binding constants in different environments, two types of simulations (molecular docking and molecular force field evaluation) are employed in the theoretical discussion. The molecular docking results were consistent with the ESI-MS experimental phenomena. Due to lack of the water molecules in the gas phase, a substantial difference in molecular interaction can contribute to a different binding affinity. By using the molecular modeling based on the force field evaluation with considering solvent molecules, β-CD is expected to form the most stable complex with ibuprofen in the liquid phase and the binding affinity of ibuprofen to γ-CD is much less significant than it is in gas phase. This prediction is in good agreement with the ACE results. Therefore, this work demonstrates that, by using ESI-MS in the first-step screening and ACE in the follow-up determination, a more accurate understanding can be achieved.",0,"Mass spectrometry and affinity capillary electrophoresis for characterization of host-guest interactions.

Finding Lead Compounds for Dengue Antivirals from a Collection of Old Drugs through In Silico Target Prediction and Subsequent In Vitro Validation.,37720780,"Dengue virus (DENV) infection is one of the most widely spread flavivirus infections. Despite the fatality it could cause, no antiviral treatment is currently available to treat the disease. Hence, this study aimed to repurpose old drugs as novel DENV NS3 inhibitors. Ligand-based (L-B) and proteochemometric (PCM) prediction models were built using 62,354 bioactivity data to screen for potential NS3 inhibitors. Selected drugs were then subjected to the foci forming unit reduction assay (FFURA) and protease inhibition assay. Finally, molecular docking was performed to validate these results. The in silico studies revealed that both models performed well in the internal and external validations. However, the L-B model showed better accuracy in the external validation in terms of its sensitivity (0.671). In the in vitro validation, all drugs (zileuton, trimethadione, and linalool) were able to moderately inhibit the viral activities at the highest concentration tested. Zileuton showed comparable results with linalool when tested at 2 mM against the DENV NS3 protease, with a reduction of protease activity at 17.89 and 18.42%, respectively. Two new compounds were also proposed through the combination of the selected drugs, which are ziltri (zilueton + trimethadione) and zilool (zileuton + linalool). The molecular docking study confirms the in vitro observations where all drugs and proposed compounds were able to achieve binding affinity ≥ -4.1 kcal/mol, with ziltri showing the highest affinity at -7.7 kcal/mol, surpassing the control, panduratin A. The occupation of both S1 and S2 subpockets of NS2B-NS3 may be essential and a reason for the lower binding energy shown by the proposed compounds compared to the screened drugs.

"Exploration of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro Inhibitors by Virtual Screening Methods, FRET Detection, and CPE Assay.",34797660,"COVID-19 caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading all over the world since the end of 2019, and no specific drug has been developed yet. 3C-like protease (3CLpro) acts as an important part of the replication of novel coronavirus and is a promising target for the development of anticoronavirus drugs. In this paper, eight machine learning models were constructed using naïve Bayesian (NB) and recursive partitioning (RP) algorithms for 3CLpro on the basis of optimized two-dimensional (2D) molecular descriptors (MDs) combined with ECFP_4, ECFP_6, and MACCS molecular fingerprints. The optimal models were selected according to the results of 5-fold cross verification, test set verification, and external test set verification. A total of 5766 natural compounds from the internal natural product database were predicted, among which 369 chemical components were predicted to be active compounds by the optimal models and the EstPGood values were more than 0.6, as predicted by the NB (MD + ECFP_6) model.

In silico prediction of novel therapeutic targets using gene-disease association data.,28851378,"Background: Target identification and validation is a pressing challenge in the pharmaceutical industry, with many of the programmes that fail for efficacy reasons showing poor association between the drug target and the disease. Computational prediction of successful targets could have a considerable impact on attrition rates in the drug discovery pipeline by significantly reducing the initial search space. Here, we explore whether gene-disease association data from the Open Targets platform is sufficient to predict therapeutic targets that are actively being pursued by pharmaceutical companies or are already on the market. Methods: To test our hypothesis, we train four different classifiers (a random forest, a support vector machine, a neural network and a gradient boosting machine) on partially labelled data and evaluate their performance using nested cross-validation and testing on an independent set. We then select the best performing model and use it to make predictions on more than 15,000 genes. Finally, we validate our predictions by mining the scientific literature for proposed therapeutic targets. Results: We observe that the data types with the best predictive power are animal models showing a disease-relevant phenotype, differential expression in diseased tissue and genetic association with the disease under investigation. On a test set, the neural network classifier achieves over 71% accuracy with an AUC of 0.76 when predicting therapeutic targets in a semi-supervised learning setting. We use this model to gain insights into current and failed programmes and to predict 1431 novel targets, of which a highly significant proportion has been independently proposed in the literature. Conclusions: Our in silico approach shows that data linking genes and diseases is sufficient to predict novel therapeutic targets effectively and confirms that this type of evidence is essential for formulating or strengthening hypotheses in the target discovery process. Ultimately, more rapid and automated target prioritisation holds the potential to reduce both the costs and the development times associated with bringing new medicines to patients.",1,"In silico prediction of novel therapeutic targets using gene-disease association data.

DrugE-Rank: improving drug-target interaction prediction of new candidate drugs or targets by ensemble learning to rank.,27307615,"Motivation: Identifying drug-target interactions is an important task in drug discovery. To reduce heavy time and financial cost in experimental way, many computational approaches have been proposed.

Methods: Approaches based on machine learning for this problem can be divided into two types: feature-based and similarity-based methods. Learning to rank is the most powerful technique in the feature-based methods. Similarity-based methods are well accepted, due to their idea of connecting the chemical and genomic spaces, represented by drug and target similarities, respectively. We propose a new method, DrugE-Rank, to improve the prediction performance by nicely combining the advantages of the two different types of methods.

QSAR classification-based virtual screening followed by molecular docking studies for identification of potential inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase.,30321850,"Developments of novel inhibitors to prevent the function of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) proteins that are responsible for a variety of inflammatory and allergic disease are a major challenge in the scientific community. In this study, robust QSAR classification models for predicting 5-LOX activity were developed using machine learning algorithms. The Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbour (NN) and Decision Trees were adopted to improve the prediction ability of the classification models. The most informative molecular descriptors that contribute to the prediction of 5-LOX activity are screened from e-Dragon, Ochem, PowerMV and Combined databases using Filter-based feature selection methods such as Correlation Feature Selection (CFS) and Information Gain (IG).

FLONE: fully Lorentz network embedding for inferring novel drug targets.,37275772,"Motivation: To predict drug targets, graph-based machine-learning methods have been widely used to capture the relationships between drug, target and disease entities in drug-disease-target (DDT) networks. However, many methods cannot explicitly consider disease types at inference time and so will predict the same target for a given drug under any disease condition. Meanwhile, DDT networks are usually organized hierarchically carrying interactive relationships between involved entities, but these methods, especially those based on Euclidean embedding cannot fully utilize such topological information, which might lead to sub-optimal results. We hypothesized that, by importing hyperbolic embedding specifically for modeling hierarchical DDT networks, graph-based algorithms could better capture relationships between aforementioned entities, which ultimately improves target prediction performance. Results: We formulated the target prediction problem as a knowledge graph completion task explicitly considering disease types. We proposed FLONE, a hyperbolic embedding-based method based on capturing hierarchical topological information in DDT networks. The experimental results on two DDT networks showed that by introducing hyperbolic space, FLONE generates more accurate target predictions than its Euclidean counterparts, which supports our hypothesis. We also devised hyperbolic encoders to fuse external domain knowledge, to make FLONE enable handling samples corresponding to previously unseen drugs and targets for more practical scenarios.

eTOX ALLIES: an automated pipeLine for linear interaction energy-based simulations.,29159598,"Background: Computational methods to predict binding affinities of small ligands toward relevant biological (off-)targets are helpful in prioritizing the screening and synthesis of new drug candidates, thereby speeding up the drug discovery process. However, use of ligand-based approaches can lead to erroneous predictions when structural and dynamic features of the target substantially affect ligand binding. Free energy methods for affinity computation can include steric and electrostatic protein-ligand interactions, solvent effects, and thermal fluctuations, but often they are computationally demanding and require a high level of supervision. As a result their application is typically limited to the screening of small sets of compounds by experts in molecular modeling. Results: We have developed eTOX ALLIES, an open source framework that allows the automated prediction of ligand-binding free energies requiring the ligand structure as only input. eTOX ALLIES is based on the linear interaction energy approach, an efficient end-point free energy method derived from Free Energy Perturbation theory. Upon submission of a ligand or dataset of compounds, the tool performs the multiple steps required for binding free-energy prediction (docking, ligand topology creation, molecular dynamics simulations, data analysis), making use of external open source software where necessary. Moreover, functionalities are also available to enable and assist the creation and calibration of new models. In addition, a web graphical user interface has been developed to allow use of free-energy based models to users that are not an expert in molecular modeling.

Specific gene module pair-based target identification and drug discovery.,36726786,"Identification of the biological targets of a compound is of paramount importance for the exploration of the mechanism of action of drugs and for the development of novel drugs.

In the present study, we have developed 2D-quantitative structure-activity relationship (2D-QSAR) models for 19 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents targeted against presynaptic vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). VAChT assists in the transport of ACh into the presynaptic storage vesicles, and it becomes one of the main targets for the diagnosis of various neurodegenerative diseases.

This was done by feature selection using a Genetic Algorithm followed by the Best Subset Selection method and developing a Partial Least Squares- based 2D-QSAR model using the best feature combination. The developed QSAR model showed significant statistical performance and reliability. Using the features selected in the 2D-QSAR analysis, we have also performed similarity-based chemical read-across predictions and obtained encouraging external validation statistics. Further, we have also performed molecular docking analysis to understand the molecular interactions occurring between the PET imaging agents and the VAChT receptor.

The neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) plays a ubiquitous role in cognitive functions including learning and memory with widespread innervation in the cortex, subcortical structures, and the cerebellum. Cholinergic receptors, transporters, or enzymes associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), are potential imaging targets. In the present study, we have developed 2D-quantitative structure-activity relationship (2D-QSAR) models for 19 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents targeted against presynaptic vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). VAChT assists in the transport of ACh into the presynaptic storage vesicles, and it becomes one of the main targets for the diagnosis of various neurodegenerative diseases. In our work, we aimed to understand the important structural features of the PET imaging agents required for their binding with VAChT. This was done by feature selection using a Genetic Algorithm followed by the Best Subset Selection method and developing a Partial Least Squares- based 2D-QSAR model using the best feature combination. The developed QSAR model showed significant statistical performance and reliability. Using the features selected in the 2D-QSAR analysis, we have also performed similarity-based chemical read-across predictions and obtained encouraging external validation statistics. Further, we have also performed molecular docking analysis to understand the molecular interactions occurring between the PET imaging agents and the VAChT receptor. The molecular docking results were correlated with the QSAR features for a better understanding of the molecular interactions. This research serves to fulfill the experimental data gap, highlighting the applicability of computational methods in the PET imaging agents' binding affinity prediction."
SELF-BLM: Prediction of drug-target interactions via self-training SVM.,28192537,"Predicting drug-target interactions is important for the development of novel drugs and the repositioning of drugs. To predict such interactions, there are a number of methods based on drug and target protein similarity. Although these methods, such as the bipartite local model (BLM), show promise, they often categorize unknown interactions as negative interaction. Therefore, these methods are not ideal for finding potential drug-target interactions that have not yet been validated as positive interactions. Thus, here we propose a method that integrates machine learning techniques, such as self-training support vector machine (SVM) and BLM, to develop a self-training bipartite local model (SELF-BLM) that facilitates the identification of potential interactions. The method first categorizes unlabeled interactions and negative interactions among unknown interactions using a clustering method. Then, using the BLM method and self-training SVM, the unlabeled interactions are self-trained and final local classification models are constructed. When applied to four classes of proteins that include enzymes, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and nuclear receptors, SELF-BLM showed the best performance for predicting not only known interactions but also potential interactions in three protein classes compare to other related studies.

Independent reports have indicated the cidal effects of statins against the flatworm parasite, S. mansoni, and the possibility that SmHMGR is a useful drug target to develop new statin-based anti-schistosome therapies.

Predicting affinity through homology (PATH): interpretable binding affinity prediction with persistent homology,38014181,"Accurate binding affinity prediction is crucial to structure-based drug design. Recent work used computational topology to obtain an effective representation of protein-ligand interactions.

Sequence-based prediction of protein binding regions and drug-target interactions.,35135622,"Identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) is important for drug discovery. However, searching all drug-target spaces poses a major bottleneck. Therefore, recently many deep learning models have been proposed to address this problem.

We hypothesized that training a model to predict important regions on a protein sequence would increase DTI prediction performance and provide a more interpretable model. Consequently, we constructed a deep learning model, named Highlights on Target Sequences (HoTS), which predicts binding regions (BRs) between a protein sequence and a drug ligand, as well as DTIs between them. To train the model, we collected complexes of protein-ligand interactions and protein sequences of binding sites and pretrained the model to predict BRs for a given protein sequence-ligand pair via object detection employing transformers. After pretraining the BR prediction, we trained the model to predict DTIs from a compound token designed to assign attention to BRs. We confirmed that training the BRs prediction model indeed improved the DTI prediction performance. The proposed HoTS model showed good performance in BR prediction on independent test datasets even though it does not use 3D structure information in its prediction. Furthermore, the HoTS model achieved the best performance in DTI prediction on test datasets. Additional analysis confirmed the appropriate attention for BRs and the importance of transformers in BR and DTI prediction.

DeepConv-DTI: Prediction of drug-target interactions via deep learning with convolution on protein sequences.,31199797,"Identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) plays a key role in drug discovery. The high cost and labor-intensive nature of in vitro and in vivo experiments have highlighted the importance of in silico-based DTI prediction approaches. In several computational models, conventional protein descriptors have been shown to not be sufficiently informative to predict accurate DTIs. Thus, in this study, we propose a deep learning based DTI prediction model capturing local residue patterns of proteins participating in DTIs. When we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) on raw protein sequences, we perform convolution on various lengths of amino acids subsequences to capture local residue patterns of generalized protein classes. We train our model with large-scale DTI information and demonstrate the performance of the proposed model using an independent dataset that is not seen during the training phase. As a result, our model performs better than previous protein descriptor-based models. Also, our model performs better than the recently developed deep learning models for massive prediction of DTIs. By examining pooled convolution results, we confirmed that our model can detect binding sites of proteins for DTIs. In conclusion, our prediction model for detecting local residue patterns of target proteins successfully enriches the protein features of a raw protein sequence, yielding better prediction results than previous approaches.

Elucidating the Functional Roles of Spatial Organization in Cross-Membrane Signal Transduction by a Hybrid Simulation Method.,27028148,"The ligand-binding of membrane receptors on cell surfaces initiates the dynamic process of cross-membrane signal transduction. It is an indispensable part of the signaling network for cells to communicate with external environments. Recent experiments revealed that molecular components in signal transduction are not randomly mixed, but spatially organized into distinctive patterns. These patterns, such as receptor clustering and ligand oligomerization, lead to very different gene expression profiles. However, little is understood about the molecular mechanisms and functional impacts of this spatial-temporal regulation in cross-membrane signal transduction. In order to tackle this problem, we developed a hybrid computational method that decomposes a model of signaling network into two simulation modules. The physical process of binding between receptors and ligands on cell surfaces are simulated by a diffusion-reaction algorithm, while the downstream biochemical reactions are modeled by stochastic simulation of Gillespie algorithm. These two processes are coupled together by a synchronization framework. Using this method, we tested the dynamics of a simple signaling network in which the ligand binding of cell surface receptors triggers the phosphorylation of protein kinases, and in turn regulates the expression of target genes. We found that spatial aggregation of membrane receptors at cellular interfaces is able to either amplify or inhibit downstream signaling outputs, depending on the details of clustering mechanism. Moreover, by providing higher binding avidity, the co-localization of ligands into multi-valence complex modulates signaling in very different ways that are closely related to the binding affinity between ligand and receptor. We also found that the temporal oscillation of the signaling pathway that is derived from genetic feedback loops can be modified by the spatial clustering of membrane receptors.

The BERT model in this study is robust and the proposed pipeline can be used to identify previously overlooked articles containing quantitative DTIs. Overall, our method provides a significant advancement in machine-assisted DTI extraction and curation. We expect it to be a useful addition to drug mechanism discovery and repurposing."

Drug Target Group Prediction with Multiple Drug Networks.,31267864,"Identification of drug-target interaction is essential in drug discovery. It is beneficial to predict unexpected therapeutic or adverse side effects of drugs. To date, several computational methods have been proposed to predict drug-target interactions because they are prompt and low-cost compared with traditional wet experiments. In this study, we investigated this problem in a different way. According to KEGG, drugs were classified into several groups based on their target proteins. A multi-label classification model was presented to assign drugs into correct target groups. To make full use of the known drug properties, five networks were constructed, each of which represented drug associations in one property. A powerful network embedding method, Mashup, was adopted to extract drug features from above-mentioned networks, based on which several machine learning algorithms, including RAndom k-labELsets (RAKEL) algorithm, Label Powerset (LP) algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were used to build the classification model. Tenfold cross-validation yielded the accuracy of 0.839, exact match of 0.816 and hamming loss of 0.037, indicating good performance of the model. The contribution of each network was also analyzed.

Moonlighting protein prediction using physico-chemical and evolutional properties via machine learning methods.,34030624,"Background: Moonlighting proteins (MPs) are a subclass of multifunctional proteins in which more than one independent or usually distinct function occurs in a single polypeptide chain. Identification of unknown cellular processes, understanding novel protein mechanisms, improving the prediction of protein functions, and gaining information about protein evolution are the main reasons to study MPs. They also play an important role in disease pathways and drug-target discovery. Since detecting MPs experimentally is quite a challenge, most of them are detected randomly. Therefore, introducing an appropriate computational approach to predict MPs seems reasonable. Results: In this study, we introduced a competent model for detecting moonlighting and non-MPs through extracted features from protein sequences. We attempted to set up a well-judged scheme for detecting outlier proteins. Consequently, 37 distinct feature vectors were utilized to study each protein's impact on detecting MPs. Furthermore, 8 different classification methods were assessed to find the best performance. To detect outliers, each one of the classifications was executed 100 times by tenfold cross-validation on feature vectors; proteins which misclassified 90 times or more were grouped. This process was applied to every single feature vector and eventually the intersection of these groups was determined as the outlier proteins. The results of tenfold cross-validation on a dataset of 351 samples (containing 215 moonlighting and 136 non-moonlighting proteins) reveal that the SVM method on all feature vectors has the highest performance among all methods in this study and other available methods. Besides, the study of outliers showed that 57 of 351 proteins in the dataset could be an appropriate candidate for the outlier. Among the outlier proteins, there were non-MPs (such as P69797) that have been misclassified in 8 different classification methods with 16 different feature vectors. Because these proteins have been obtained by computational methods, the results of this study could reduce the likelihood of hypothesizing whether these proteins are non-moonlighting at all.

Inferring Drug-Target Interactions Based on Random Walk and Convolutional Neural Network.,33729947,"Computational strategies for identifying new drug-target interactions (DTIs) can guide the process of drug discovery, reduce the cost and time of drug development, and thus promote drug development.

The multitype predictor calculates the type similarity between the type perceptor and predicted interactions, and the domain gate module is reconstructed to assign an adaptive weight to each type perceptor. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed MPM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in DTI prediction."

To find out the potent bioactive compounds to counteract COVID-19, we use systems pharmacology and cheminformatics. They use the definitive data and predict the possible outcomes. In this study, we collected a total of 72 phytocompounds from the medicinally important plants such as Garcinia mangostana and Cinnamomum verum, of which 13 potential phytocompounds were identified to be active against the COVID-19 infection based on Swiss Target Prediction and compound target network analysis. These phytocompounds were annotated to identify the specific human receptor that targets COVID-19-specific genes such as MAPK8, MAPK14, ACE, CYP3A4, TLR4 and TYK2. Among these, compounds such as smeathxanthone A, demethylcalabaxanthone, mangostanol, trapezifolixanthone from Garcinia mangostana and camphene from C. verum were putatively target various COVID-19-related genes.

Network pharmacological evaluation of strigolactones efficacy as potential inhibitors against therapeutic targets of hepatocellular carcinoma.,35672528,"Purpose: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the uncontrolled growth of hepatocytes which results in nearly 5 million deaths worldwide. Specific strategies have been developed to treat HCC, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. But, the effective disease dealing requires synergistic collaboration with other approaches, which often results in moderate to severe side effects during and after the treatment period. Therefore, the focus is now shifting to explore and retrieve those plant-based products that could be utilized to treat HCC with maximum efficacy without causing any side effects. Strigolactones (SL) are compounds of plant origin derived from Striga lutea responsible for controlling the branching pattern of stem and have reported anti-cancerous activity by promoting apoptosis at micromolar concentrations. However, little work has been done concerning determining the pharmacogenomic effect of strigolactones on HCC. Methods: Current work focuses on comparing therapeutic efficiencies of SL analogs against core targets of HCC using network pharmacology approach, pharmacokinetics analysis, gene ontogeny, functional enrichment analysis, molecular docking and Molecular Dynamics simulation. Results: Drug-target prediction and functional enrichment analysis showed that HDAC1 and HDAC2 are the core proteins involved in hepatocellular carcinoma that strigolactone analogs can target. Consequently, results from molecular docking and MD simulation analyses report that among all the SL analogs strigol, epistrigol and nijmegen1 can turn out to be most effective in downregulating the expression of HDAC1, HDAC2 and CYP19A.

Matrix factorization with denoising autoencoders for prediction of drug-target interactions.,35871213,"Drug-target interaction is crucial in the discovery of new drugs. Computational methods can be used to identify new drug-target interactions at low costs and with reasonable accuracy. Recent studies pay more attention to machine-learning methods, ranging from matrix factorization to deep learning, in the DTI prediction.

Computational prediction of the effect of amino acid changes on the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and human ACE2.,34588290,"The association of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) represents the first required step for cellular entry.

Reliably predicting the effect of amino acid changes on the ability of the RBD to interact more strongly with the hACE2 can help assess the implications for public health and the potential for spillover and adaptation into other animals. Here, we introduce a two-step framework that first relies on 48 independent 4-ns molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of RBD-hACE2 variants to collect binding energy terms decomposed into Coulombic, covalent, van der Waals, lipophilic, generalized Born solvation, hydrogen bonding, π-π packing, and self-contact correction terms. The second step implements a neural network to classify and quantitatively predict binding affinity changes using the decomposed energy terms as descriptors. The computational base achieves a validation accuracy of 82.8% for classifying single-amino acid substitution variants of the RBD as worsening or improving binding affinity for hACE2 and a correlation coefficient of 0.73 between predicted and experimentally calculated changes in binding affinities.

Subsequently, the obtained target matrices and molecule graph were utilized as inputs for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) to extract hidden features, which were further used for the prediction of binding affinity. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted several experiments and made a comprehensive comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches using multiple evaluation metrics. The results of our experiments demonstrated that the KC-DTA method achieves high performance in predicting drug-target affinity (DTA). The findings of this research underscore the significance of the KC-DTA method as a valuable tool in the field of <i>in silico</i> drug discovery, offering promising opportunities for accelerating the drug development process.

DeepNC: a framework for drug-target interaction prediction with graph neural networks.,35578674,"The exploration of drug-target interactions (DTI) is an essential stage in the drug development pipeline.

However, they can hardly utilize the natural graph structure of molecular inputs. For that reason, a graph neural network (GNN) is an applicable choice for learning the chemical and structural characteristics of molecules when it represents molecular compounds as graphs and learns the compound features from those graphs.

Predicting HLA CD4 Immunogenicity in Human Populations.,29963059,"Background: Prediction of T cell immunogenicity is a topic of considerable interest, both in terms of basic understanding of the mechanisms of T cells responses and in terms of practical applications. HLA binding affinity is often used to predict T cell epitopes, since HLA binding affinity is a key requisite for human T cell immunogenicity. However, immunogenicity at the population it is complicated by the high level of variability of HLA molecules, potential other factors beyond HLA as well as the frequent lack of HLA typing data. To overcome those issues, we explored an alternative approach to identify the common characteristics able to distinguish immunogenic peptides from non-recognized peptides. Methods: Sets of dominant epitopes derived from peer-reviewed published papers were used in conjunction with negative peptides from the same experiments/donors to train neural networks and generate an 'immunogenicity score.' We also compared the performance of the immunogenicity score with previously described method for immunogenicity prediction based on HLA class II binding at the population level. Results: The immunogenicity score was validated on a series of independent datasets derived from the published literature, representing 57 independent studies where immunogenicity in human populations was assessed by testing overlapping peptides spanning different antigens. Overall, these testing datasets corresponded to over 2,000 peptides and tested in over 1,600 different human donors. The 7-allele method prediction and the immunogenicity score were associated with similar performance [average area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.703 and 0.702, respectively] while the combined methods reached an average AUC of 0.725. This increase in average AUC value is significant compared with the immunogenicity score (p = 0.0135) and a strong trend toward significance is observed when compared to the 7-allele method (p = 0.0938).

Investigating function roles of hypothetical proteins encoded by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv genome.,31113361,"Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a common bacterium causing tuberculosis and remains a major pathogen for mortality. Although the MTB genome has been extensively explored for two decades, the functions of 27% (1051/3906) of encoded proteins have yet to be determined and these proteins are annotated as hypothetical proteins. Methods: We assigned functions to these hypothetical proteins using SSEalign, a newly designed algorithm utilizing structural information. A set of rigorous criteria was applied to these annotations in order to examine whether they were supported by each parameter. Virulence factors and potential drug targets were also screened among the annotated proteins. Results: For 78% (823/1051) of the hypothetical proteins, we could identify homologs in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium by using SSEalign. Functional classification analysis indicated that 62.2% (512/823) of these annotated proteins were enzymes with catalytic activities and most of these annotations were supported by at least two other independent parameters. A relatively high proportion of transporter was identified in MTB genome, indicating the potential frequent transportation of frequent absorbing essential metabolites and excreting toxic materials in MTB. Twelve virulence factors and ten vaccine candidates were identified within these MTB hypothetical proteins, including two genes (rpoS and pspA) related to stress response to the host immune system. Furthermore, we have identified six novel drug target candidates among our annotated proteins, including Rv0817 and Rv2927c, which could be used for treating MTB infection.

Interactions between RNA and proteins are pervasive in biology, driving fundamental processes such as protein translation and participating in the regulation of gene expression. Modeling the energies of RNA-protein interactions is therefore critical for understanding and repurposing living systems but has been hindered by complexities unique to RNA-protein binding. Here, we bring together several advances to complete a calculation framework for RNA-protein binding affinities, including a unified free energy function for bound complexes, automated Rosetta modeling of mutations, and use of secondary structure-based energetic calculations to model unbound RNA states. The resulting Rosetta-Vienna RNP-ΔΔG method achieves root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) of 1.3 kcal/mol on high-throughput MS2 coat protein-RNA measurements and 1.5 kcal/mol on an independent test set involving the signal recognition particle, human U1A, PUM1, and FOX-1. As a stringent test, the method achieves RMSE accuracy of 1.4 kcal/mol in blind predictions of hundreds of human PUM2-RNA relative binding affinities. Overall, these RMSE accuracies are significantly better than those attained by prior structure-based approaches applied to the same systems. Importantly, Rosetta-Vienna RNP-ΔΔG establishes a framework for further improvements in modeling RNA-protein binding that can be tested by prospective high-throughput measurements on new systems."
CSM-carbohydrate: protein-carbohydrate binding affinity prediction and docking scoring function.,34882232,"Protein-carbohydrate interactions are crucial for many cellular processes but can be challenging to biologically characterise. To improve our understanding and ability to model these molecular interactions, we used a carefully curated set of 370 protein-carbohydrate complexes with experimental structural and biophysical data in order to train and validate a new tool, cutoff scanning matrix (CSM)-carbohydrate, using machine learning algorithms to accurately predict their binding affinity and rank docking poses as a scoring function. Information on both protein and carbohydrate complementarity, in terms of shape and chemistry, was captured using graph-based structural signatures. Across both training and independent test sets, we achieved comparable Pearson's correlations of 0.72 under cross-validation [root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.58 Kcal/mol] and 0.67 on the independent test (RMSE of 1.72 Kcal/mol), providing confidence in the generalisability and robustness of the final model. Similar performance was obtained across mono-, di- and oligosaccharides, further highlighting the applicability of this approach to the study of larger complexes.

DTI-SNNFRA: Drug-target interaction prediction by shared nearest neighbors and fuzzy-rough approximation.,33606741,"In-silico prediction of repurposable drugs is an effective drug discovery strategy that supplements de-nevo drug discovery from scratch. Reduced development time, less cost and absence of severe side effects are significant advantages of using drug repositioning. Most recent and most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have boosted drug repurposing in terms of throughput and accuracy enormously. However, with the growing number of drugs, targets and their massive interactions produce imbalanced data which may not be suitable as input to the classification model directly. Here, we have proposed DTI-SNNFRA, a framework for predicting drug-target interaction (DTI), based on shared nearest neighbour (SNN) and fuzzy-rough approximation (FRA). It uses sampling techniques to collectively reduce the vast search space covering the available drugs, targets and millions of interactions between them. DTI-SNNFRA operates in two stages: first, it uses SNN followed by a partitioning clustering for sampling the search space. Next, it computes the degree of fuzzy-rough approximations and proper degree threshold selection for the negative samples' undersampling from all possible interaction pairs between drugs and targets obtained in the first stage. Finally, classification is performed using the positive and selected negative samples. We have evaluated the efficacy of DTI-SNNFRA using AUC (Area under ROC Curve), Geometric Mean, and F1 Score. The model performs exceptionally well with a high prediction score of 0.95 for ROC-AUC.

Integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing reveals tumor heterogeneity and a signature based on NK cell marker genes for predicting prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.,37397471,"Background: Natural killer (NK) cells are a type of innate immune cell that recognize and eliminate tumor cells and infected cells, without prior sensitization or activation. Herein, we aimed to construct a predictive model based on NK cell-related genes for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and assess the feasibility of utilizing this model for prognosis prediction. Methods: Single-cell RNA-seq data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify marker genes of NK cells. Univariate Cox and lasso regression were performed to further establish a signature in the TCGA dataset. Subsequently, qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining were employed to validate the expression levels of prognosis signature genes in HCC. The effectiveness of the model was further validated using two external cohorts from the GEO and ICGC datasets. Clinical characteristics, prognosis, tumor mutation burden, immune microenvironments, and biological function were compared for different genetic subtypes and risk groups. Finally, molecular docking was performed to evaluate the binding affinity between the hub gene and chemotherapeutic drugs. Results: A total of 161 HCC-related NK cell marker genes (NKMGs) were identified, 28 of which were significantly associated with overall survival in HCC patients. Based on differences in gene expression characteristics, HCC patients were classified into three subtypes. Ten prognosis genes (KLRB1, CD7, LDB2, FCER1G, PFN1, FYN, ACTG1, PABPC1, CALM1, and RPS8) were screened to develop a prognosis model. The model not only demonstrated excellent predictive performance on the training dataset, but also were successfully validated on two independent external datasets. The risk scores derived from the model were shown to be an independent prognosis factor for HCC and were correlated with pathological severity. Moreover, qPCR and IHC staining confirmed that the expression of the prognosis genes was generally consistent with the results of the bioinformatic analysis. Finally, molecular docking revealed favorable binding energies between the hub gene ACTG1 and chemotherapeutic drugs.

DeepMHCI: an anchor position-aware deep interaction model for accurate MHC-I peptide binding affinity prediction.,37669154,"Motivation: Computationally predicting major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) peptide binding affinity is an important problem in immunological bioinformatics, which is also crucial for the identification of neoantigens for personalized therapeutic cancer vaccines. Recent cutting-edge deep learning-based methods for this problem cannot achieve satisfactory performance, especially for non-9-mer peptides. This is because such methods generate the input by simply concatenating the two given sequences: a peptide and (the pseudo sequence of) an MHC class I molecule, which cannot precisely capture the anchor positions of the MHC binding motif for the peptides with variable lengths. We thus developed an anchor position-aware and high-performance deep model, DeepMHCI, with a position-wise gated layer and a residual binding interaction convolution layer. This allows the model to control the information flow in peptides to be aware of anchor positions and model the interactions between peptides and the MHC pseudo (binding) sequence directly with multiple convolutional kernels. Results: The performance of DeepMHCI has been thoroughly validated by extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets under various settings, such as 5-fold cross-validation, validation with the independent testing set, external HPV vaccine identification, and external CD8+ epitope identification.

Specifically, starting with the construction of the original ncRNA-drug resistance association as a bipartite graph, RDRGSE took advantage of a bi-view skeleton extraction strategy to obtain two types of skeleton views, followed by a graph neural network-based estimator for iteratively optimizing skeleton views aimed at learning high-quality ncRNA-drug resistance edge embedding and optimal graph skeleton structure, jointly. Then, RDRGSE adopted adaptive attentional feature fusion to obtain final edge embedding and identified potential RDRAs under an end-to-end pattern. Comprehensive experiments were conducted, and experimental results indicated the significant advantage of a skeleton structure for ncRNA-drug resistance association discovery. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, RDRGSE improved the prediction performance by 6.7% in terms of AUC and 6.1% in terms of AUPR. Also, ablation-like analysis and independent case studies corroborated RDRGSE generalization ability and robustness.

Drug-Target Interaction Prediction Based on Drug Fingerprint Information and Protein Sequence.,31430892,"The identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a critical step in drug development. Experimental methods that are based on clinical trials to discover DTIs are time-consuming, expensive, and challenging. Therefore, as complementary to it, developing new computational methods for predicting novel DTI is of great significance with regards to saving cost and shortening the development period. In this paper, we present a novel computational model for predicting DTIs, which uses the sequence information of proteins and a rotation forest classifier. Specifically, all of the target protein sequences are first converted to a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) to retain evolutionary information. We then use local phase quantization (LPQ) descriptors to extract evolutionary information in the PSSM. On the other hand, substructure fingerprint information is utilized to extract the features of the drug. We finally combine the features of drugs and protein together to represent features of each drug-target pair and use a rotation forest classifier to calculate the scores of interaction possibility, for a global DTI prediction.

Identifying Patient Populations in Texts Describing Drug Approvals Through Deep Learning-Based Information Extraction: Development of a Natural Language Processing Algorithm.,37347514,"Background: New drug treatments are regularly approved, and it is challenging to remain up-to-date in this rapidly changing environment. Fast and accurate visualization is important to allow a global understanding of the drug market. Automation of this information extraction provides a helpful starting point for the subject matter expert, helps to mitigate human errors, and saves time. Objective: We aimed to semiautomate disease population extraction from the free text of oncology drug approval descriptions from the BioMedTracker database for 6 selected drug targets. More specifically, we intended to extract (1) line of therapy, (2) stage of cancer of the patient population described in the approval, and (3) the clinical trials that provide evidence for the approval. We aimed to use these results in downstream applications, aiding the searchability of relevant content against related drug project sources. Methods: We fine-tuned a state-of-the-art deep learning model, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, for each of the 3 desired outputs. We independently applied rule-based text mining approaches. We compared the performances of deep learning and rule-based approaches and selected the best method, which was then applied to new entries. The results were manually curated by a subject matter expert and then used to train new models. Results: The training data set is currently small (433 entries) and will enlarge over time when new approval descriptions become available or if a choice is made to take another drug target into account. The deep learning models achieved 61% and 56% 5-fold cross-validated accuracies for line of therapy and stage of cancer, respectively, which were treated as classification tasks. Trial identification is treated as a named entity recognition task, and the 5-fold cross-validated F1-score is currently 87%. Although the scores of the classification tasks could seem low, the models comprise 5 classes each, and such scores are a marked improvement when compared to random classification. Moreover, we expect improved performance as the input data set grows, since deep learning models need to be trained on a large enough amount of data to be able to learn the task they are taught. The rule-based approach achieved 60% and 74% 5-fold cross-validated accuracies for line of therapy and stage of cancer, respectively.

EGCG identified as an autophagy inducer for rosacea therapy.,36937834,"Background: Rosacea is a common facial skin inflammatory disease featured by hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling in the epidermis.

Methods: Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) analyzed the relationship between epidermis autophagy and mTOR pathways in rosacea, and further demonstrated it through immunofluorescence and qPCR analysis. A potential therapeutic agent for rosacea was predicted based on the key genes of the WGCNA module. In vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted to verify its therapeutic role. Drug-target prediction (TargetNet, Swiss, and Tcmsp) and molecular docking offered potential pharmacological targets. Results: WGCNA showed that epidermis autophagy was related to the activation of mTOR pathways in rosacea. Next, autophagy was downregulated in the epidermis of rosacea, which was regulated by mTOR. In addition, the in vivo experiment demonstrated that autophagy induction could be an effective treatment strategy for rosacea.

Optimizing the affinity and specificity of ligand binding with the inclusion of solvation effect.,26111900,"Solvation effect is an important factor for protein-ligand binding in aqueous water. Previous scoring function of protein-ligand interactions rarely incorporates the solvation model into the quantification of protein-ligand interactions, mainly due to the immense computational cost, especially in the structure-based virtual screening, and nontransferable application of independently optimized atomic solvation parameters. In order to overcome these barriers, we effectively combine knowledge-based atom-pair potentials and the atomic solvation energy of charge-independent implicit solvent model in the optimization of binding affinity and specificity. The resulting scoring functions with optimized atomic solvation parameters is named as specificity and affinity with solvation effect (SPA-SE). The performance of SPA-SE is evaluated and compared to 20 other scoring functions, as well as SPA.

Solvation effect is an important factor for protein-ligand binding in aqueous water. Previous scoring function of protein-ligand interactions rarely incorporates the solvation model into the quantification of protein-ligand interactions, mainly due to the immense computational cost, especially in the structure-based virtual screening, and nontransferable application of independently optimized atomic solvation parameters. In order to overcome these barriers, we effectively combine knowledge-based atom-pair potentials and the atomic solvation energy of charge-independent implicit solvent model in the optimization of binding affinity and specificity. The resulting scoring functions with optimized atomic solvation parameters is named as specificity and affinity with solvation effect (SPA-SE). The performance of SPA-SE is evaluated and compared to 20 other scoring functions, as well as SPA. The comparative results show that SPA-SE outperforms all other scoring functions in binding affinity prediction and 'native' pose identification. Our optimization validates that solvation effect is an important regulator to the stability and specificity of protein-ligand binding.

An ensemble learning approach for modeling the systems biology of drug-induced injury.,33435983,"Background: Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is an adverse reaction caused by the intake of drugs of common use that produces liver damage. The impact of DILI is estimated to affect around 20 in 100,000 inhabitants worldwide each year. Despite being one of the main causes of liver failure, the pathophysiology and mechanisms of DILI are poorly understood. In the present study, we developed an ensemble learning approach based on different features (CMap gene expression, chemical structures, drug targets) to predict drugs that might cause DILI and gain a better understanding of the mechanisms linked to the adverse reaction. Results: We searched for gene signatures in CMap gene expression data by using two approaches: phenotype-gene associations data from DisGeNET, and a non-parametric test comparing gene expression of DILI-Concern and No-DILI-Concern drugs (as per DILIrank definitions). The average accuracy of the classifiers in both approaches was 69%. We used chemical structures as features, obtaining an accuracy of 65%. The combination of both types of features produced an accuracy around 63%, but improved the independent hold-out test up to 67%. The use of drug-target associations as feature obtained the best accuracy (70%) in the independent hold-out test. Conclusions: When using CMap gene expression data, searching for a specific gene signature among the landmark genes improves the quality of the classifiers, but it is still limited by the intrinsic noise of the dataset. When using chemical structures as a feature, the structural diversity of the known DILI-causing drugs hampers the prediction, which is a similar problem as for the use of gene expression information. The combination of both features did not improve the quality of the classifiers but increased the robustness as shown on independent hold-out tests.

Machine learning prediction of oncology drug targets based on protein and network properties.,32171238,"Background: The selection and prioritization of drug targets is a central problem in drug discovery. Computational approaches can leverage the growing number of large-scale human genomics and proteomics data to make in-silico target identification, reducing the cost and the time needed. Results: We developed a machine learning approach to score proteins to generate a druggability score of novel targets. In our model we incorporated 70 protein features which included properties derived from the sequence, features characterizing protein functions as well as network properties derived from the protein-protein interaction network. The advantage of this approach is that it is unbiased and even less studied proteins with limited information about their function can score well as most of the features are independent of the accumulated literature. We build models on a training set which consist of targets with approved drugs and a negative set of non-drug targets. The machine learning techniques help to identify the most important combination of features differentiating validated targets from non-targets. We validated our predictions on an independent set of clinical trial drug targets, achieving a high accuracy characterized by an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.89. Our most predictive features included biological function of proteins, network centrality measures, protein essentiality, tissue specificity, localization and solvent accessibility. Our predictions, based on a small set of 102 validated oncology targets, recovered the majority of known drug targets and identifies a novel set of proteins as drug target candidates. Conclusions: We developed a machine learning approach to prioritize proteins according to their similarity to approved drug targets. We have shown that the method proposed is highly predictive on a validation dataset consisting of 277 targets of clinical trial drug confirming that our computational approach is an efficient and cost-effective tool for drug target discovery and prioritization.

Prediction of Drug-Target Interactions by Combining Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform with Ensemble Learning Method.,34500792,"Identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is vital for drug discovery. However, traditional biological approaches have some unavoidable shortcomings, such as being time consuming and expensive. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel and effective computational methods to predict DTIs in order to shorten the development cycles of new drugs. In this study, we present a novel computational approach to identify DTIs, which uses protein sequence information and the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). More specifically, a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) was performed on the target protein sequence to obtain its evolutionary information. Then, DTCWT was used to extract representative features from the PSSM, which were then combined with the drug fingerprint features to form the feature descriptors. Finally, these descriptors were sent to the Rotation Forest (RoF) model for classification. A 5-fold cross validation (CV) was adopted on four datasets (Enzyme, Ion Channel, GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors), and NRs (Nuclear Receptors)) to validate the proposed model; our method yielded high average accuracies of 89.21%, 85.49%, 81.02%, and 74.44%, respectively. To further verify the performance of our model, we compared the RoF classifier with two state-of-the-art algorithms: the support vector machine (SVM) and the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier.

CAPi: Computational Model for Apicoplast Inhibitors Prediction Against Plasmodium Parasite.,28260517,"Background: Discovery of apicoplast as a drug target offers a new direction in the development of novel anti-malarial compounds, especially against the drug-resistant strains.

Therefore, in this study, we developed a computational model to predict apicoplast inhibitors by applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Methods: We have used two high-throughput chemical screening data (AID-504850, AID-504848) from PubChem BioAssay database and applied machine learning techniques. The performance of the models were assessed on various types of binary fingerprints. Results: In this study, we developed a robust computational algorithm for the prediction of apicoplast inhibition. We observed 73.7% sensitivity and 84% specificity along with 81.4% accuracy rate only on 41 PubChem fingerprints on 48 hrs dataset. Similarly, an accuracy rate of 75.8% was observed for 96 hrs dataset. Additionally, we observed that our model has ~70% positive prediction rate on the independent dataset obtained from ChEMBL-NTD database. Furthermore, the fingerprint analysis suggested that compounds with at least one heteroatom containing hexagonal ring would most likely belong to the antimalarial category as compared to simple aliphatic compounds.

How to approach machine learning-based prediction of drug/compound-target interactions.,36747300,"The identification of drug/compound-target interactions (DTIs) constitutes the basis of drug discovery, for which computational predictive approaches have been developed. As a relatively new data-driven paradigm, proteochemometric (PCM) modeling utilizes both protein and compound properties as a pair at the input level and processes them via statistical/machine learning. The representation of input samples (i.e., proteins and their ligands) in the form of quantitative feature vectors is crucial for the extraction of interaction-related properties during the artificial learning and subsequent prediction of DTIs. Lately, the representation learning approach, in which input samples are automatically featurized via training and applying a machine/deep learning model, has been utilized in biomedical sciences. In this study, we performed a comprehensive investigation of different computational approaches/techniques for protein featurization (including both conventional approaches and the novel learned embeddings), data preparation and exploration, machine learning-based modeling, and performance evaluation with the aim of achieving better data representations and more successful learning in DTI prediction. For this, we first constructed realistic and challenging benchmark datasets on small, medium, and large scales to be used as reliable gold standards for specific DTI modeling tasks. We developed and applied a network analysis-based splitting strategy to divide datasets into structurally different training and test folds. Using these datasets together with various featurization methods, we trained and tested DTI prediction models and evaluated their performance from different angles. Our main findings can be summarized under 3 items: (i) random splitting of datasets into train and test folds leads to near-complete data memorization and produce highly over-optimistic results, as a result, should be avoided, (ii) learned protein sequence embeddings work well in DTI prediction and offer high potential, despite interaction-related properties (e.g., structures) of proteins are unused during their self-supervised model training, and (iii) during the learning process, PCM models tend to rely heavily on compound features while partially ignoring protein features, primarily due to the inherent bias in DTI data, indicating the requirement for new and unbiased datasets. We hope this study will aid researchers in designing robust and high-performing data-driven DTI prediction systems that have real-world translational value in drug discovery.",0,"How to approach machine learning-based prediction of drug/compound-target interactions.

SPVec: A Word2vec-Inspired Feature Representation Method for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction.,31998687,"Drug discovery is an academical and commercial process of global importance. Accurate identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) can significantly facilitate the drug discovery process.

However, upstream feature extraction methods require tremendous human resources and expert insights, which limits the application of ML approaches. Inspired by the unsupervised representation learning methods like Word2vec, we here proposed SPVec, a novel way to automatically represent raw data such as SMILES strings and protein sequences into continuous, information-rich and lower-dimensional vectors, so as to avoid the sparseness and bit collisions from the cumbersomely manually extracted features. Visualization of SPVec nicely illustrated that the similar compounds or proteins occupy similar vector space, which indicated that SPVec not only encodes compound substructures or protein sequences efficiently, but also implicitly reveals some important biophysical and biochemical patterns. Compared with manually-designed features like MACCS fingerprints and amino acid composition (AAC), SPVec showed better performance with several state-of-art machine learning classifiers such as Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, Random Forest and Deep Neural Network on BindingDB. The performance and robustness of SPVec were also confirmed on independent test sets obtained from DrugBank database. Also, based on the whole DrugBank dataset, we predicted the possibilities of all unlabeled DTIs, where two of the top five predicted novel DTIs were supported by external evidences.

Aiming at the above issue, this work presents an end-to-end DTA prediction method named MSF-DTA (Multi-Source Feature Fusion-based Drug-Target Affinity). The contributions can be summarized as follows. First, MSF-DTA adopts a novel ""neighboring feature""-based protein representation. Instead of utilizing only the inherent features of a target protein, MSF-DTA gathers additional information for the target protein from its biologically related ""neighboring"" proteins in PPI (i.e., protein-protein interaction) and SSN (i.e., sequence similarity) networks to get prior knowledge. Second, the representation was learned using an advanced graph pre-training framework, VGAE, which could not only gather node features but also learn topological connections, therefore contributing to a richer protein representation and benefiting the downstream DTA prediction task. This study provides new perspective for the DTA prediction task, and evaluation results demonstrated that MSF-DTA obtained superior performances compared to current state-of-the-art methods.",0,"Predicting Drug-Target Affinity by Learning Protein Knowledge From Biological Networks.

Multiview network embedding for drug-target Interactions prediction by consistent and complementary information preserving.,35262678,"Accurate prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs) can reduce the cost and time of drug repositioning and drug discovery.

A Multi-Label Learning Framework for Drug Repurposing.,31505805,"Drug repurposing plays an important role in screening old drugs for new therapeutic efficacy. The existing methods commonly treat prediction of drug-target interaction as a problem of binary classification, in which a large number of randomly sampled drug-target pairs accounting for over 50% of the entire training dataset are necessarily required. Such a large number of negative examples that do not come from experimental observations inevitably decrease the credibility of predictions. In this study, we propose a multi-label learning framework to find new uses for old drugs and discover new drugs for known target genes. In the framework, each drug is treated as a class label and its target genes are treated as the class-specific training data to train a supervised learning model of l2-regularized logistic regression. As such, the inter-drug associations are explicitly modelled into the framework and all the class-specific training data come from experimental observations. In addition, the data constraint is less demanding, for instance, the chemical substructures of a drug are no longer needed and the novel target genes are inferred only from the underlying patterns of the known genes targeted by the drug. Stratified multi-label cross-validation shows that 84.9% of known target genes have at least one drug correctly recognized, and the proposed framework correctly recognizes 86.73% of the independent test drug-target interactions (DTIs) from DrugBank. These results show that the proposed framework could generalize well in the large drug/class space without the information of drug chemical structures and target protein structures.

A likely HOXC4 predisposition variant for Chiari malformations.,36433874,"Objective: Inherited variants predisposing patients to type 1 or 1.5 Chiari malformation (CM) have been hypothesized but have proven difficult to confirm. The authors used a unique high-risk pedigree population resource and approach to identify rare candidate variants that likely predispose individuals to CM and protein structure prediction tools to identify pathogenicity mechanisms. Methods: By using the Utah Population Database, the authors identified pedigrees with significantly increased numbers of members with CM diagnosis. From a separate DNA biorepository of 451 samples from CM patients and families, 32 CM patients belonging to 1 or more of 24 high-risk Chiari pedigrees were identified. Two high-risk pedigrees had 3 CM-affected relatives, and 22 pedigrees had 2 CM-affected relatives. To identify rare candidate predisposition gene variants, whole-exome sequence data from these 32 CM patients belonging to 24 CM-affected related pairs from high-risk pedigrees were analyzed. The I-TASSER package for protein structure prediction was used to predict the structures of both the wild-type and mutant proteins found here. Results: Sequence analysis of the 24 affected relative pairs identified 38 rare candidate Chiari predisposition gene variants that were shared by at least 1 CM-affected pair from a high-risk pedigree. The authors found a candidate variant in HOXC4 that was shared by 2 CM-affected patients in 2 independent pedigrees. All 4 of these CM cases, 2 in each pedigree, exhibited a specific craniocervical bony phenotype defined by a clivoaxial angle less than 125°. The protein structure prediction results suggested that the mutation considered here may reduce the binding affinity of HOXC4 to DNA. Conclusions: Analysis of unique and powerful Utah genetic resources allowed identification of 38 strong candidate CM predisposition gene variants.

Machine Learning on Human Muscle Transcriptomic Data for Biomarker Discovery and Tissue-Specific Drug Target Identification.,30050560,"For the past several decades, research in understanding the molecular basis of human muscle aging has progressed significantly. However, the development of accessible tissue-specific biomarkers of human muscle aging that may be measured to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions is still a major challenge. Here we present a method for tracking age-related changes of human skeletal muscle. We analyzed publicly available gene expression profiles of young and old tissue from healthy donors. Differential gene expression and pathway analysis were performed to compare signatures of young and old muscle tissue and to preprocess the resulting data for a set of machine learning algorithms. Our study confirms the established mechanisms of human skeletal muscle aging, including dysregulation of cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis, PPAR signaling and neurotransmitter recycling along with IGFR and PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling. Applying several supervised machine learning techniques, including neural networks, we built a panel of tissue-specific biomarkers of aging. Our predictive model achieved 0.91 Pearson correlation with respect to the actual age values of the muscle tissue samples, and a mean absolute error of 6.19 years on the test set. The performance of models was also evaluated on gene expression samples of the skeletal muscles from the Gene expression Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. The best model achieved the accuracy of 0.80 with respect to the actual age bin prediction on the external validation set. Furthermore, we demonstrated that aging biomarkers can be used to identify new molecular targets for tissue-specific anti-aging therapies.",1,"Machine Learning on Human Muscle Transcriptomic Data for Biomarker Discovery and Tissue-Specific Drug Target Identification. For the past several decades, research in understanding the molecular basis of human muscle aging has progressed significantly. However, the development of accessible tissue-specific biomarkers of human muscle aging that may be measured to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions is still a major challenge. Here we present a method for tracking age-related changes of human skeletal muscle. We analyzed publicly available gene expression profiles of young and old tissue from healthy donors. Differential gene expression and pathway analysis were performed to compare signatures of young and old muscle tissue and to preprocess the resulting data for a set of machine learning algorithms.

Comprehensive analysis of endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated genes signature of ulcerative colitis.,37287987,"Background: Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is a critical factor in the development of ulcerative colitis (UC); however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to identify pivotal molecular mechanisms related to ERS in UC pathogenesis and provide novel therapeutic targets for UC. Methods: Colon tissue gene expression profiles and clinical information of UC patients and healthy controls were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and the ERS-related gene set was downloaded from GeneCards for analysis. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential expression analysis were utilized to identify pivotal modules and genes associated with UC. A consensus clustering algorithm was used to classify UC patients. The CIBERSORT algorithm was employed to evaluate the immune cell infiltration. Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were used to explore potential biological mechanisms. The external sets were used to validate and identify the relationship of ERS-related genes with biologics. Small molecule compounds were predicted using the Connectivity Map (CMap) database. Molecular docking was performed to simulate the binding conformation of small molecule compounds and key targets. Results: The study identified 915 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 11 ERS-related genes (ERSRGs) from the colonic mucosa of UC patients and healthy controls, and these genes had good diagnostic value and were highly correlated. Five potential small-molecule drugs sharing tubulin inhibitors were identified, including albendazole, fenbendazole, flubendazole, griseofulvin, and noscapine, among which noscapine exhibited the highest correlation with a high binding affinity to the targets. Active UC and 10 ERSRGs were associated with a large number of immune cells, and ERS was also associated with colon mucosal invasion of active UC. Significant differences in gene expression patterns and immune cell infiltration abundance were observed among ERS-related subtypes. Conclusion: The results suggest that ERS plays a vital role in UC pathogenesis, and noscapine may be a promising therapeutic agent for UC by affecting ERS.",1,"Comprehensive analysis of endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated genes signature of ulcerative colitis.

NLLSS: Predicting Synergistic Drug Combinations Based on Semi-supervised Learning.,27415801,"Fungal infection has become one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired infections with high mortality rates. Furthermore, drug resistance is common for fungus-causing diseases. Synergistic drug combinations could provide an effective strategy to overcome drug resistance. Meanwhile, synergistic drug combinations can increase treatment efficacy and decrease drug dosage to avoid toxicity. Therefore, computational prediction of synergistic drug combinations for fungus-causing diseases becomes attractive. In this study, we proposed similar nature of drug combinations: principal drugs which obtain synergistic effect with similar adjuvant drugs are often similar and vice versa. Furthermore, we developed a novel algorithm termed Network-based Laplacian regularized Least Square Synergistic drug combination prediction (NLLSS) to predict potential synergistic drug combinations by integrating different kinds of information such as known synergistic drug combinations, drug-target interactions, and drug chemical structures. We applied NLLSS to predict antifungal synergistic drug combinations and showed that it achieved excellent performance both in terms of cross validation and independent prediction. Finally, we performed biological experiments for fungal pathogen Candida albicans to confirm 7 out of 13 predicted antifungal synergistic drug combinations. NLLSS provides an efficient strategy to identify potential synergistic antifungal combinations.",1,"NLLSS: Predicting Synergistic Drug Combinations Based on Semi-supervised Learning.
