DrugormerDTI: Drug Graphormer for drug-target interaction prediction.,37244151,"Drug-target interactions (DTI) prediction is a crucial task in drug discovery.

"Deciphering the pharmacological mechanisms of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi on oral leukoplakia by combining network pharmacology, molecular docking and experimental evaluations.",35667260,"Oral leukoplakia (OLK), an uncharacterized pathological condition that occurs as a white patch in the oral mucosa, is the most common precancerous condition. Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (SBG) is a medicinal plant with a wide range of pharmacological effects. Increased evidence shows
that SBG has potential therapeutic effects on OLK. However, the therapeutic mechanisms of SBG against OLK have not yet been completely elucidated. This study aimed to clarify the active components and multi-target mechanisms of SBG against OLK via network pharmacology, molecular docking and
experimental evaluations. The active components and related targets of SBG were screened by the TCMSP database and Swiss Target Prediction database. Potential therapeutic targets of OLK were collected using the GeneCards and OMIM databases. Then, we established protein-protein interaction (PPI),
compound-target-disease (C-T-D), and compound-target-pathway (C-T-P) networks by Cytoscape to identify the main components, core targets, and pharmacological pathways of SBG against OLK via applying data mining techniques and topological parameters. Metascape database was utilized for GO and KEGG
pathway analysis. Molecular docking techniques were used to estimate the binding force between the components and the hub genes. Subsequently, a series of in vitro experiments, specifically CCK-8 assay, clone formation assay, wound healing assay, flow cytometry, RT-qPCR and western blotting were
conducted for further verification. There were 25 active components and 31 related target genes in SBG against OLK. PPI analysis showed that Akt1, VEGFA, EGFR, HIF1A and PTGS2 shared the highest centrality among all target genes. KEGG pathway analysis found that PI3K-Akt signaling pathway may occupy
core status in the anti-OLK system. Molecular docking results showed that the main active components of SBG had a strong binding affinity to the hub genes. In vitro experiments showed that the leading component baicalein may inhibit proliferation, block cells in the S phase, induce DOK cell
apoptosis, and downregulate the mRNA expression of 5 hub genes by inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway activation. The most predominant component of SBG against OLK was baicalein and the key pathway was PI3K/Akt. The main components and hub genes had robust binding abilities. In vitro experiments

Machine learning based personalized drug response prediction for lung cancer patients.,36344580,"Lung cancers with a mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are a major contributor to cancer fatalities globally. Targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed against EGFR and show encouraging results for survival rate and quality of life. However, drug

was modeled considering MD simulation to extract molecular-level geometric features. Moreover, additional clinical features were incorporated into machine learning model for drug response prediction. The complete feature set includes demographic and clinical information (DCI), geometrical properties

Identifying potential drug-target interactions based on ensemble deep learning.,37396659,"Drug-target interaction prediction is one important step in drug research and development.

cross validations on drugs, targets, and drug-target pairs, respectively. EnGDD computed the best recall, accuracy, F1-score, AUC, and AUPR under the majority of conditions, demonstrating its powerful DTI identification performance. EnGDD predicted that D00182 and hsa2099, D07871 and hsa1813,

Inverse similarity and reliable negative samples for drug side-effect prediction.,30717666,"In silico prediction of potential drug side-effects is of crucial importance for drug development, since wet experimental identification of drug side-effects is expensive and time-consuming. Existing computational methods mainly focus on leveraging validated drug side-effect relations for

similar drugs are inclined to share the same side-effects, which has given rise to remarkable performance. It is also rational to assume an inverse proposition that dissimilar drugs are less likely to share the same side-effects. Based on this inverse similarity hypothesis, we proposed a novel
method to select highly-reliable negative samples for side-effect prediction. The first step of our method is to build a drug similarity integration framework to measure the similarity between drugs from different perspectives. This step integrates drug chemical structures, drug target proteins,
drug substituents, and drug therapeutic information as features into a unified framework. Then, a similarity score between each candidate negative drug and validated positive drugs is calculated using the similarity integration framework. Those candidate negative drugs with lower similarity scores
are preferentially selected as negative samples. Finally, both the validated positive drugs and the selected highly-reliable negative samples are used for predictions. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on simulative side-effect prediction of 917 DrugBank drugs, comparing with four
machine-learning algorithms. Extensive experiments show that the drug similarity integration framework has superior capability in capturing drug features, achieving much better performance than those based on a single type of drug property. Besides, the four machine-learning algorithms achieved
significant improvement in macro-averaging F1-score (e.g., SVM from 0.655 to 0.898), macro-averaging precision (e.g., RBF from 0.592 to 0.828) and macro-averaging recall (e.g., KNN from 0.651 to 0.772) complimentarily attributed to the highly-reliable negative samples selected by the proposed

DeepDTA: deep drug-target binding affinity prediction.,30423097,"The identification of novel drug-target (DT) interactions is a substantial part of the drug discovery process.

Multitype Perception Method for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction.,37314917,"With the growing popularity of artificial intelligence in drug discovery, many deep-learning technologies have been used to automatically predict unknown drug-target interactions (DTIs).

Unfortunately, existing methods tend to learn the specifical knowledge on each interaction type and they usually ignore the knowledge diversity across different interaction
types. Therefore, we propose a multitype perception method (MPM) for DTI prediction by exploiting knowledge diversity across different link types. The method consists of two main components: a type perceptor and a multitype predictor. The type perceptor learns distinguished edge representations by
retaining the specifical features across different interaction types; this maximizes the prediction performance for each interaction type. The multitype predictor calculates the type similarity between the type perceptor and predicted interactions, and the domain gate module is reconstructed to

associated with drug-SE pairs from the resulting set of parse trees. We developed pattern-ranking algorithms to prioritize drug-SE-specific patterns. We then selected a set of patterns with both high precisions and recalls in order to extract drug-SE pairs from the entire MEDLINE. In total, we
extracted 38,871 drug-SE pairs from MEDLINE using the learned patterns, the majority of which have not been captured in FDA drug labels to date. On average, our knowledge-driven pattern-learning approach in extracting drug-SE pairs from MEDLINE has achieved a precision of 0.833, a recall of 0.407,
and an F1 of 0.545. We compared our approach to a support vector machine (SVM)-based machine learning and a co-occurrence statistics-based approach. We show that the pattern-learning approach is largely complementary to the SVM- and co-occurrence-based approaches with significantly higher precision
and F1 but lower recall. We demonstrated by correlation analysis that the extracted drug side effects correlate positively with both drug targets, metabolism, and indications."
The structure-based cancer-related single amino acid variation prediction.,34193921,"Single amino acid variation (SAV) is an amino acid substitution of the protein sequence that can potentially influence the entire protein structure or function, as well as its binding affinity. Protein destabilization is related to diseases, including several cancers, although using
traditional experiments to clarify the relationship between SAVs and cancer uses much time and resources. Some SAV prediction methods use computational approaches, with most predicting SAV-induced changes in protein stability. In this investigation, all SAV characteristics generated from protein
sequences, structures and the microenvironment were converted into feature vectors and fed into an integrated predicting system using a support vector machine and genetic algorithm. Critical features were used to estimate the relationship between their properties and cancers caused by SAVs. We
describe how we developed a prediction system based on protein sequences and structure that is capable of distinguishing if the SAV is related to cancer or not. The five-fold cross-validation performance of our system is 89.73% for the accuracy, 0.74 for the Matthews correlation coefficient, and
0.81 for the F1 score.

Predicting Affinity Through Homology (PATH): Interpretable Binding Affinity Prediction with Persistent Homology.,38014181,"Accurate binding affinity prediction is crucial to structure-based drug design. Recent work used computational topology to obtain an effective representation of protein-ligand interactions.
