Discovery of Potential Flavonoid Inhibitors Against COVID-19 3CL Proteinase Based on Virtual Screening Strategy.,33134310,"The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused serious threat to public health. Discovery of new anti-COVID-19 drugs is urgently needed. Fortunately, the crystal structure of COVID-19 3CL proteinase was recently resolved. The proteinase has been identified as a promising target for drug discovery in this crisis. Here, a dataset including 2030 natural compounds was screened and refined based on the machine learning and molecular docking. The performance of six machine learning (ML) methods of predicting active coronavirus inhibitors had achieved satisfactory accuracy, especially, the AUC (Area Under ROC Curve) scores with fivefold cross-validation of Logistic Regression (LR) reached up to 0.976. Comprehensive ML prediction and molecular docking results accounted for the compound Rutin, which was approved by NMPA (National Medical Products Administration), exhibited the best AUC and the most promising binding affinity compared to other compounds. Therefore, Rutin might be a promising agent in anti-COVID-19 drugs development.",1,"Discovery of Potential Flavonoid Inhibitors Against COVID-19 3CL Proteinase Based on Virtual Screening Strategy.

MOKPE: drug-target interaction prediction via manifold optimization based kernel preserving embedding.,37407927,"In many applications of bioinformatics, data stem from distinct heterogeneous sources. One of the well-known examples is the identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs), which is of significant importance in drug discovery. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, manifold optimization based kernel preserving embedding (MOKPE), to efficiently solve the problem of modeling heterogeneous data. Our model projects heterogeneous drug and target data into a unified embedding space by preserving drug-target interactions and drug-drug, target-target similarities simultaneously. We performed ten replications of ten-fold cross validation on four different drug-target interaction network data sets for predicting DTIs for previously unseen drugs. The classification evaluation metrics showed better or comparable performance compared to previous similarity-based state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated MOKPE on predicting unknown DTIs of a given network. Our implementation of the proposed algorithm in R together with the scripts that replicate the reported experiments is publicly available at https://github.com/ocbinatli/mokpe .",1,"MOKPE: drug-target interaction prediction via manifold optimization based kernel preserving embedding.

BiComp-DTA: Drug-target binding affinity prediction through complementary biological-related and compression-based featurization approach.,37000857,"Drug-target binding affinity prediction plays a key role in the early stage of drug discovery. Numerous experimental and data-driven approaches have been developed for predicting drug-target binding affinity. However, experimental methods highly rely on the limited structural-related information from drug-target pairs, domain knowledge, and time-consuming assays. On the other hand, learning-based methods have shown an acceptable prediction performance. However, most of them utilize several simple and complex types of proteins and drug compounds data, ranging from the protein sequences to the topology of a graph representation of drug compounds, employing multiple deep neural networks for encoding and feature extraction, and so, leads to the computational overheads. In this study, we propose a unified measure for protein sequence encoding, named BiComp, which provides compression-based and evolutionary-related features from the protein sequences. Specifically, we employ Normalized Compression Distance and Smith-Waterman measures for capturing complementary information from the algorithmic information theory and biological domains, respectively. We utilize the proposed measure to encode the input proteins feeding a new deep neural network-based method for drug-target binding affinity prediction, named BiComp-DTA. BiComp-DTA is evaluated utilizing four benchmark datasets for drug-target binding affinity prediction. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, which employ complex models for protein encoding and feature extraction, BiComp-DTA provides superior efficiency in terms of accuracy, runtime, and the number of trainable parameters. The latter achievement facilitates execution of BiComp-DTA on a normal desktop computer in a fast fashion. As a comparative study, we evaluate BiComp's efficiency against its components for drug-target binding affinity prediction. The results have shown superior accuracy of BiComp due to the orthogonality and complementary nature of Smith-Waterman and Normalized Compression Distance measures for protein sequences. Such a protein sequence encoding provides efficient representation with no need for multiple sources of information, deep domain knowledge, and complex neural networks.",0,"BiComp-DTA: Drug-target binding affinity prediction through complementary biological-related and compression-based featurization approach.

Computational prediction of the effect of amino acid changes on the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and human ACE2.,34588290,"The association of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) represents the first required step for cellular entry. SARS-CoV-2 has continued to evolve with the emergence of several novel variants, and amino acid changes in the RBD have been implicated with increased fitness and potential for immune evasion. Reliably predicting the effect of amino acid changes on the ability of the RBD to interact more strongly with the hACE2 can help assess the implications for public health and the potential for spillover and adaptation into other animals. Here, we introduce a two-step framework that first relies on 48 independent 4-ns molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of RBD-hACE2 variants to collect binding energy terms decomposed into Coulombic, covalent, van der Waals, lipophilic, generalized Born solvation, hydrogen bonding, π-π packing, and self-contact correction terms. The second step implements a neural network to classify and quantitatively predict binding affinity changes using the decomposed energy terms as descriptors. The computational base achieves a validation accuracy of 82.8% for classifying single-amino acid substitution variants of the RBD as worsening or improving binding affinity for hACE2 and a correlation coefficient of 0.73 between predicted and experimentally calculated changes in binding affinities. Both metrics are calculated using a fivefold cross-validation test. Our method thus sets up a framework for screening binding affinity changes caused by unknown single- and multiple-amino acid changes offering a valuable tool to predict host adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 variants toward tighter hACE2 binding.",1,"Computational prediction of the effect of amino acid changes on the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and human ACE2.

"Prediction of In-silico ADME Properties of 1,2-O-Isopropylidene Aldohexose Derivatives.",25276190,"Retention behaviour of molecules mostly depends on their chemical structure. Retention data of biologically active molecules could be an indirect relationship between their structure and biological or pharmacological activity, since the molecular structure affects their behaviour in all pharmacokinetic stages. In the present paper, retention parameters (R M (0)) of biologically active 1,2-O-isopropylidene aldohexose derivatives, obtained by normal-phase thin-layer chromatography (NP TLC), were correlated with selected physicochemical properties relevant to pharmacokinetics, i.e. absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) properties. Conducted correlation analysis showed high dependence between R M (0) and blood brain barrier penetration, skin permeability, enzyme inhibition, binding affinity to nuclear receptor ligand and G protein-coupled receptors, as well as lipophilicity (expressed as Hansh-Leo's parameter Clog P). The statistical validity of the established polynomial dependence of the second degree between R M (0) and mentioned ADME properties was confirmed by standard statistical measures and leave-one-out cross-validation method. On the basis of in-silico calculated ADME properties and retention data, the similarity between studied molecules was examined using principal component analysis (PCA). The obtained results indicate the possibility of predicting ADME properties of studied compounds on the basis of their retention data (R M (0)).

Identifying Patient Populations in Texts Describing Drug Approvals Through Deep Learning-Based Information Extraction: Development of a Natural Language Processing Algorithm.,37347514,"Background: New drug treatments are regularly approved, and it is challenging to remain up-to-date in this rapidly changing environment. Fast and accurate visualization is important to allow a global understanding of the drug market. Automation of this information extraction provides a helpful starting point for the subject matter expert, helps to mitigate human errors, and saves time. Objective: We aimed to semiautomate disease population extraction from the free text of oncology drug approval descriptions from the BioMedTracker database for 6 selected drug targets. More specifically, we intended to extract (1) line of therapy, (2) stage of cancer of the patient population described in the approval, and (3) the clinical trials that provide evidence for the approval. We aimed to use these results in downstream applications, aiding the searchability of relevant content against related drug project sources. Methods: We fine-tuned a state-of-the-art deep learning model, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, for each of the 3 desired outputs. We independently applied rule-based text mining approaches. We compared the performances of deep learning and rule-based approaches and selected the best method, which was then applied to new entries. The results were manually curated by a subject matter expert and then used to train new models. Results: The training data set is currently small (433 entries) and will enlarge over time when new approval descriptions become available or if a choice is made to take another drug target into account. The deep learning models achieved 61% and 56% 5-fold cross-validated accuracies for line of therapy and stage of cancer, respectively, which were treated as classification tasks. Trial identification is treated as a named entity recognition task, and the 5-fold cross-validated F1-score is currently 87%. Although the scores of the classification tasks could seem low, the models comprise 5 classes each, and such scores are a marked improvement when compared to random classification. Moreover, we expect improved performance as the input data set grows, since deep learning models need to be trained on a large enough amount of data to be able to learn the task they are taught. The rule-based approach achieved 60% and 74% 5-fold cross-validated accuracies for line of therapy and stage of cancer, respectively. No attempt was made to define a rule-based approach for trial identification. Conclusions: We developed a natural language processing algorithm that is currently assisting subject matter experts in disease population extraction, which supports health authority approvals. This algorithm achieves semiautomation, enabling subject matter experts to leverage the results for deeper analysis and to accelerate information retrieval in a crowded clinical environment such as oncology.",1,"Identifying Patient Populations in Texts Describing Drug Approvals Through Deep Learning-Based Information Extraction: Development of a Natural Language Processing Algorithm.

"QSAR-driven screening uncovers and designs novel pyrimidine-4,6-diamine derivatives as potent JAK3 inhibitors.",38059345,"This study presents a robust and integrated methodology that harnesses a range of computational techniques to facilitate the design and prediction of new inhibitors targeting the JAK3/STAT pathway. This methodology encompasses several strategies, including QSAR analysis, pharmacophore modeling, ADMET prediction, covalent docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and the calculation of binding free energies (MM/GBSA). An efficacious QSAR model was meticulously crafted through the employment of multiple linear regression (MLR). The initial MLR model underwent further refinement employing an artificial neural network (ANN) methodology aimed at minimizing predictive errors. Notably, both MLR and ANN exhibited commendable performance, showcasing R2 values of 0.89 and 0.95, respectively. The model's precision was assessed via leave-one-out cross-validation (CV) yielding a Q2 value of 0.65, supplemented by rigorous Y-randomization. , The pharmacophore model effectively differentiated between active and inactive drugs, identifying potential JAK3 inhibitors, and demonstrated validity with an ROC value of 0.86. The newly discovered and designed inhibitors exhibited high inhibitory potency, ranging from 6 to 8, as accurately predicted by the QSAR models. Comparative analysis with FDA-approved Tofacitinib revealed that the new compounds exhibited promising ADMET properties and strong covalent docking (CovDock) interactions. The stability of the new discovered and designed inhibitors within the JAK3 binding site was confirmed through 500 ns MD simulations, while MM/GBSA calculations supported their binding affinity. Additionally, a retrosynthetic study was conducted to facilitate the synthesis of these potential JAK3/STAT inhibitors.

Applied machine learning for predicting the lanthanide-ligand binding affinities.,32868845,"Binding affinities of metal-ligand complexes are central to a multitude of applications like drug design, chelation therapy, designing reagents for solvent extraction etc. While state-of-the-art molecular modelling approaches are usually employed to gather structural and chemical insights about the metal complexation with ligands, their computational cost and the limited ability to predict metal-ligand stability constants with reasonable accuracy, renders them impractical to screen large chemical spaces. In this context, leveraging vast amounts of experimental data to learn the metal-binding affinities of ligands becomes a promising alternative. Here, we develop a machine learning framework for predicting binding affinities (logK1) of lanthanide cations with several structurally diverse molecular ligands.

DTI-SNNFRA: Drug-target interaction prediction by shared nearest neighbors and fuzzy-rough approximation.,33606741,"In-silico prediction of repurposable drugs is an effective drug discovery strategy that supplements de-nevo drug discovery from scratch. Reduced development time, less cost and absence of severe side effects are significant advantages of using drug repositioning. Most recent and most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have boosted drug repurposing in terms of throughput and accuracy enormously. However, with the growing number of drugs, targets and their massive interactions produce imbalanced data which may not be suitable as input to the classification model directly. Here, we have proposed DTI-SNNFRA, a framework for predicting drug-target interaction (DTI), based on shared nearest neighbour (SNN) and fuzzy-rough approximation (FRA). It uses sampling techniques to collectively reduce the vast search space covering the available drugs, targets and millions of interactions between them. DTI-SNNFRA operates in two stages: first, it uses SNN followed by a partitioning clustering for sampling the search space. Next, it computes the degree of fuzzy-rough approximations and proper degree threshold selection for the negative samples' undersampling from all possible interaction pairs between drugs and targets obtained in the first stage. Finally, classification is performed using the positive and selected negative samples. We have evaluated the efficacy of DTI-SNNFRA using AUC (Area under ROC Curve), Geometric Mean, and F1 Score.

Predicting affinity through homology (PATH): interpretable binding affinity prediction with persistent homology,38014181,"Accurate binding affinity prediction is crucial to structure-based drug design. Recent work used computational topology to obtain an effective representation of protein-ligand interactions. Although persistent homology encodes geometric features, previous works on binding affinity prediction using persistent homology employed uninterpretable machine learning models and failed to explain the underlying geometric and topological features that drive accurate binding affinity prediction. In this work, we propose a novel, interpretable algorithm for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. Our algorithm achieves interpretability through an effective embedding of distances across bipartite matchings of the protein and ligand atoms into real-valued functions by summing Gaussians centered at features constructed by persistent homology. We name these functions <i>internuclear persistent contours (IPCs)</i> . Next, we introduce <i>persistence fingerprints</i> , a vector with 10 components that sketches the distances of different bipartite matching between protein and ligand atoms, refined from IPCs. Let the number of protein atoms in the protein-ligand complex be <i>n</i> , number of ligand atoms be <i>m</i> , and <i>ω</i> ≈ 2.4 be the matrix multiplication exponent. We show that for any 0 < <i>ε</i> < 1, after an 𝒪 ( <i>mn</i> log( <i>mn</i> )) preprocessing procedure, we can compute an <i>ε</i> -accurate approximation to the persistence fingerprint in 𝒪 ( <i>m</i> log <sup>6 <i>ω</i></sup> ( <i>m/""</i> )) time, independent of protein size. This is an improvement in time complexity by a factor of 𝒪 (( <i>m</i> + <i>n</i> ) <sup>3</sup> ) over any previous binding affinity prediction that uses persistent homology. We show that the representational power of persistence fingerprint generalizes to protein-ligand binding datasets beyond the training dataset. Then, we introduce <i>PATH</i> , Predicting Affinity Through Homology, an interpretable, small ensemble of shallow regression trees for binding affinity prediction from persistence fingerprints.

The source code for PATH is released open-source as part of the osprey protein design software package.",0,"Predicting affinity through homology (PATH): interpretable binding affinity prediction with persistent homology Accurate binding affinity prediction is crucial to structure-based drug design. Recent work used computational topology to obtain an effective representation of protein-ligand interactions. Although persistent homology encodes geometric features, previous works on binding affinity prediction using persistent homology employed uninterpretable machine learning models and failed to explain the underlying geometric and topological features that drive accurate binding affinity prediction. In this work, we propose a novel, interpretable algorithm for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. Our algorithm achieves interpretability through an effective embedding of distances across bipartite matchings of the protein and ligand atoms into real-valued functions by summing Gaussians centered at features constructed by persistent homology. We name these functions <i>internuclear persistent contours (IPCs)</i> . Next, we introduce <i>persistence fingerprints</i> , a vector with 10 components that sketches the distances of different bipartite matching between protein and ligand atoms, refined from IPCs. Let the number of protein atoms in the protein-ligand complex be <i>n</i> , number of ligand atoms be <i>m</i> , and <i>ω</i> ≈ 2.4 be the matrix multiplication exponent. We show that for any 0 < <i>ε</i> < 1, after an 𝒪 ( <i>mn</i> log( <i>mn</i> )) preprocessing procedure, we can compute an <i>ε</i> -accurate approximation to the persistence fingerprint in 𝒪 ( <i>m</i> log <sup>6 <i>ω</i></sup> ( <i>m/""</i> )) time, independent of protein size. This is an improvement in time complexity by a factor of 𝒪 (( <i>m</i> + <i>n</i> ) <sup>3</sup> ) over any previous binding affinity prediction that uses persistent homology. We show that the representational power of persistence fingerprint generalizes to protein-ligand binding datasets beyond the training dataset. Then, we introduce <i>PATH</i> , Predicting Affinity Through Homology, an interpretable, small ensemble of shallow regression trees for binding affinity prediction from persistence fingerprints. We show that despite using 1,400-fold fewer features, PATH has comparable performance to a previous state-of-the-art binding affinity prediction algorithm that uses persistent homology features. Moreover, PATH has the advantage of being interpretable.

Prediction of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites through an integrative model of protein context and sequence.,27507704,"Identifying kinase substrates and the specific phosphorylation sites they regulate is an important factor in understanding protein function regulation and signalling pathways. Computational prediction of kinase targets - assigning kinases to putative substrates, and selecting from protein sequence the sites that kinases can phosphorylate - requires the consideration of both the cellular context that kinases operate in, as well as their binding affinity. This consideration enables investigation of how phosphorylation influences a range of biological processes. We report here a novel probabilistic model for classifying kinase-specific phosphorylation sites from sequence across three model organisms: human, mouse and yeast. The model incorporates position-specific amino acid frequencies, and counts of co-occurring amino acids from kinase binding sites. We show how this model can be seamlessly integrated with protein interactions and cell-cycle abundance profiles. When evaluating the prediction accuracy of our method, PhosphoPICK, on an independent hold-out set of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites, it achieved an average specificity of 97%, with 32% sensitivity. We compared PhosphoPICK's ability, through cross-validation, to predict kinase-specific phosphorylation sites with alternative methods, and show that at high levels of specificity PhosphoPICK obtains greater sensitivity for most comparisons made.

BMCMDA: a novel model for predicting human microbe-disease associations via binary matrix completion.,30367598,"Background: Human Microbiome Project reveals the significant mutualistic influence between human body and microbes living in it. Such an influence lead to an interesting phenomenon that many noninfectious diseases are closely associated with diverse microbes. However, the identification of microbe-noninfectious disease associations (MDAs) is still a challenging task, because of both the high cost and the limitation of microbe cultivation. Thus, there is a need to develop fast approaches to screen potential MDAs. The growing number of validated MDAs enables us to meet the demand in a new insight. Computational approaches, especially machine learning, are promising to predict MDA candidates rapidly among a large number of microbe-disease pairs with the advantage of no limitation on microbe cultivation. Nevertheless, a few computational efforts at predicting MDAs are made so far. Results: In this paper, grouping a set of MDAs into a binary MDA matrix, we propose a novel predictive approach (BMCMDA) based on Binary Matrix Completion to predict potential MDAs. The proposed BMCMDA assumes that the incomplete observed MDA matrix is the summation of a latent parameterizing matrix and a noising matrix. It also assumes that the independently occurring subscripts of observed entries in the MDA matrix follows a binomial model. Adopting a standard mean-zero Gaussian distribution for the nosing matrix, we model the relationship between the parameterizing matrix and the MDA matrix under the observed microbe-disease pairs as a probit regression. With the recovered parameterizing matrix, BMCMDA deduces how likely a microbe would be associated with a particular disease.

Although several predictors (such as 'Euk-mPLoc', 'Euk-PLoc 2.0' and 'iLoc-Euk') can cover up to 22 different location sites, and they also have the function to treat multi-labeled proteins, further efforts are needed to improve their prediction quality, particularly in enhancing the absolute true rate and in reducing the absolute false rate. Here we propose a new predictor called 'pLoc-mEuk' by extracting the key GO (Gene Ontology) information into the general PseAAC (Pseudo Amino Acid Composition). Rigorous cross-validations on a high-quality and stringent benchmark dataset have indicated that the proposed pLoc-mEuk predictor is remarkably superior to iLoc-Euk, the best of the aforementioned three predictors. To maximize the convenience of most experimental scientists, a user-friendly web-server for the new predictor has been established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/pLoc-mEuk/, by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to go through the complicated mathematics involved."
A Framework for Improving the Generalizability of Drug-Target Affinity Prediction Models.,37988395,"<b>Statistical models that accurately predict the binding affinity of an input ligand-protein pair can greatly accelerate drug discovery. Such models are trained on available ligand-protein interaction data sets, which may contain biases that lead the predictor models to learn data set-specific, spurious patterns instead of generalizable relationships. This leads the prediction performances of these models to drop dramatically for previously unseen biomolecules. Various approaches that aim to improve model generalizability either have limited applicability or introduce the risk of degrading overall prediction performance. In this article, we present DebiasedDTA, a novel training framework for drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction models that addresses data set biases to improve the generalizability of such models. DebiasedDTA relies on reweighting the training samples to achieve robust generalization, and is thus applicable to most DTA prediction models.

Moonlighting protein prediction using physico-chemical and evolutional properties via machine learning methods.,34030624,"Background: Moonlighting proteins (MPs) are a subclass of multifunctional proteins in which more than one independent or usually distinct function occurs in a single polypeptide chain. Identification of unknown cellular processes, understanding novel protein mechanisms, improving the prediction of protein functions, and gaining information about protein evolution are the main reasons to study MPs. They also play an important role in disease pathways and drug-target discovery. Since detecting MPs experimentally is quite a challenge, most of them are detected randomly. Therefore, introducing an appropriate computational approach to predict MPs seems reasonable. Results: In this study, we introduced a competent model for detecting moonlighting and non-MPs through extracted features from protein sequences. We attempted to set up a well-judged scheme for detecting outlier proteins. Consequently, 37 distinct feature vectors were utilized to study each protein's impact on detecting MPs. Furthermore, 8 different classification methods were assessed to find the best performance. To detect outliers, each one of the classifications was executed 100 times by tenfold cross-validation on feature vectors; proteins which misclassified 90 times or more were grouped. This process was applied to every single feature vector and eventually the intersection of these groups was determined as the outlier proteins. The results of tenfold cross-validation on a dataset of 351 samples (containing 215 moonlighting and 136 non-moonlighting proteins) reveal that the SVM method on all feature vectors has the highest performance among all methods in this study and other available methods. Besides, the study of outliers showed that 57 of 351 proteins in the dataset could be an appropriate candidate for the outlier. Among the outlier proteins, there were non-MPs (such as P69797) that have been misclassified in 8 different classification methods with 16 different feature vectors. Because these proteins have been obtained by computational methods, the results of this study could reduce the likelihood of hypothesizing whether these proteins are non-moonlighting at all. Conclusions: MPs are difficult to be identified through experimentation. Using distinct feature vectors, our method enabled identification of novel moonlighting proteins.

Drug-Target Interaction Prediction Based on Drug Fingerprint Information and Protein Sequence.,31430892,"The identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a critical step in drug development. Experimental methods that are based on clinical trials to discover DTIs are time-consuming, expensive, and challenging.

In this paper, we present a novel computational model for predicting DTIs, which uses the sequence information of proteins and a rotation forest classifier.

In silico studies involving molecular docking simulations of 12 PDAs were carried out against 7 Mycobacterium tuberculosis target proteins (MTs) to determine their theoretical binding affinities. Compounds A3, A6, and B9 demonstrated stronger binding affinities on similar MTs. Molecular descriptors (MDs) describing structural and physicochemical properties of the compounds were also calculated using ChemDes, explored using Pearson's correlation analysis, and principal component analysis (PCA) in comparison with MDs from conventional antitubercular medicines.

Multiview network embedding for drug-target Interactions prediction by consistent and complementary information preserving.,35262678,"Accurate prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs) can reduce the cost and time of drug repositioning and drug discovery. Many current methods integrate information from multiple data sources of drug and target to improve DTIs prediction accuracy.

Experimental results on two datasets show that the prediction accuracy of MccDTI outperforms four state-of-the-art methods for DTIs prediction. Moreover, literature verification for DTIs prediction shows that MccDTI can predict the reliable potential DTIs.

GEFA: Early Fusion Approach in Drug-Target Affinity Prediction.,34197324,"Predicting the interaction between a compound and a target is crucial for rapid drug repurposing. Deep learning has been successfully applied in drug-target affinity (DTA)problem.

In addition, previous DTA methods learn protein representation solely based on a small number of protein sequences in DTA datasets while neglecting the use of proteins outside of the DTA datasets. We propose GEFA (Graph Early Fusion Affinity), a novel graph-in-graph neural network with attention mechanism to address the changes in target representation because of the binding effects.

Inactivation of cell-free HIV-1 by designing potent peptides based on mutations in the CD4 binding site.,37889430,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a major global health problem, with over 38 million people infected worldwide. Current anti-HIV-1 drugs are limited in their ability to prevent the virus from replicating inside host cells, making them less effective as preventive measures. In contrast, viral inhibitors that inactivate the virus before it can bind to a host cell have great potential as drugs. In this study, we aimed to design mutant peptides that could block the interaction between gp120 and the CD4 receptor on host cells, thus preventing HIV-1 infection. We designed a 20-amino-acid peptide that mimicked the amino acids of the CD4 binding site and docked it to gp120. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to calculate the energy of MMPBSA (Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area) for each residue of the peptide, and unfavorable energy residues were identified as potential mutation points. Using MAESTRO (Multi AgEnt STability pRedictiOn), we measured ΔΔG (change in the change in Gibbs free energy) for mutations and generated a library of 240 mutated peptides using OSPREY software. The peptides were then screened for allergenicity and binding affinity. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations (via GROMACS 2020.2) and control docking (via HADDOCK 2.4) were used to evaluate the ability of four selected peptides to inhibit HIV-1 infection. Three peptides, P3 (AHRQIRQWFLTRGPNRSLWQ), P4 (VHRQIRQWFLTRGPNRSLWQ), and P9 (AHRQIRQMFLTRGPNRSLWQ), showed practical and potential as HIV inhibitors, based on their binding affinity and ability to inhibit infection. These peptides have the ability to inactivate the virus before it can bind to a host cell, thus representing a promising approach to HIV-1 prevention. Our findings suggest that mutant peptides designed to block the interaction between gp120 and the CD4 receptor have potential as HIV-1 inhibitors.

Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) experiments have been performed on SARS-CoV-2's spike receptor binding domain and the human ACE2 zinc-binding peptidase domain - both central players in viral infection and evolution and antibody evasion - quantifying how mutations impact binding affinity and protein expression. Here, we modeled biochemical phenotypes from massively parallel assays, using convolutional neural networks trained on protein sequence mutations in the virus and human host. We found that neural networks are significantly predictive of binding affinity, protein expression, and antibody escape, learning complex interactions and higher-order features that are difficult to capture with conventional methods from structural biology. Integrating the intrinsic physicochemical properties of amino acids, including hydrophobicity, solvent-accessible surface area, and long-range non-bonded energy per atom, significantly improved prediction (empirical p<0.01) though there was such a strong dependence on the sequence data alone to yield reasonably good prediction.

"Ensemble Prediction of Synergistic Drug Combinations Incorporating Biological, Chemical, Pharmacological, and Network Knowledge.",29994408,"Combinatorial therapy may reduce drug side effects and improve drug efficacy, making combination therapy a promising strategy to treat complex diseases. However, in the existing computational methods, the natural properties and network knowledge of drugs have not been adequately and simultaneously considered, making it difficult to identify effective drug combinations. Computational methods that incorporate multiple sources of information (biological, chemical, pharmacological, and network knowledge) offer more opportunities to screen synergistic drug combinations. Therefore, we developed a novel Ensemble Prediction framework of Synergistic Drug Combinations (EPSDC) to accurately and efficiently predict drug combinations by integrating information from multiple-sources. EPSDC constructs feature vector of drug pair by concatenating different types of drug similarities, and then uses these groups in a feature-based base predictor. Next, transductive learning is applied on heterogeneous drug-target networks to achieve a network-based score for the drug pair. Finally, two types of ensemble rules are introduced to combine the feature-based score and the network-based score, and then potential drug combinations are prioritized. To demonstrate the effect of the ensemble rule, comprehensive experiments were conducted to compare single models and ensemble models. The experimental results indicated that our method outperformed the state-of-the-art method in five-fold cross validation and de novo prediction tests on the two benchmark datasets.

"Protein Fitness Prediction Is Impacted by the Interplay of Language Models, Ensemble Learning, and Sampling Methods.",37242577,"Advances in machine learning (ML) and the availability of protein sequences via high-throughput sequencing techniques have transformed the ability to design novel diagnostic and therapeutic proteins. ML allows protein engineers to capture complex trends hidden within protein sequences that would otherwise be difficult to identify in the context of the immense and rugged protein fitness landscape. Despite this potential, there persists a need for guidance during the training and evaluation of ML methods over sequencing data. Two key challenges for training discriminative models and evaluating their performance include handling severely imbalanced datasets (e.g., few high-fitness proteins among an abundance of non-functional proteins) and selecting appropriate protein sequence representations (numerical encodings). Here, we present a framework for applying ML over assay-labeled datasets to elucidate the capacity of sampling techniques and protein encoding methods to improve binding affinity and thermal stability prediction tasks. For protein sequence representations, we incorporate two widely used methods (One-Hot encoding and physiochemical encoding) and two language-based methods (next-token prediction, UniRep; masked-token prediction, ESM). Elaboration on performance is provided over protein fitness, protein size, and sampling techniques. In addition, an ensemble of protein representation methods is generated to discover the contribution of distinct representations and improve the final prediction score. We then implement multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA; TOPSIS with entropy weighting), using multiple metrics well-suited for imbalanced data, to ensure statistical rigor in ranking our methods. Within the context of these datasets, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) outperformed undersampling while encoding sequences with One-Hot, UniRep, and ESM representations. Moreover, ensemble learning increased the predictive performance of the affinity-based dataset by 4% compared to the best single-encoding candidate (F1-score = 97%), while ESM alone was rigorous enough in stability prediction (F1-score = 92%).",0,"Protein Fitness Prediction Is Impacted by the Interplay of Language Models, Ensemble Learning, and Sampling Methods.

Here, we present a framework for applying ML over assay-labeled datasets to elucidate the capacity of sampling techniques and protein encoding methods to improve binding affinity and thermal stability prediction tasks. For protein sequence representations, we incorporate two widely used methods (One-Hot encoding and physiochemical encoding) and two language-based methods (next-token prediction, UniRep; masked-token prediction, ESM). Elaboration on performance is provided over protein fitness, protein size, and sampling techniques. In addition, an ensemble of protein representation methods is generated to discover the contribution of distinct representations and improve the final prediction score. We then implement multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA; TOPSIS with entropy weighting), using multiple metrics well-suited for imbalanced data, to ensure statistical rigor in ranking our methods. Within the context of these datasets, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) outperformed undersampling while encoding sequences with One-Hot, UniRep, and ESM representations. Moreover, ensemble learning increased the predictive performance of the affinity-based dataset by 4% compared to the best single-encoding candidate (F1-score = 97%), while ESM alone was rigorous enough in stability prediction (F1-score = 92%)."
