GIFDTI: Prediction of Drug-Target Interactions Based on Global Molecular and Intermolecular Interaction Representation Learning.,36445997,"Drug discovery and drug repurposing often rely on the successful prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs). Recent advances have shown great promise in applying deep learning to drug-target interaction prediction. One challenge in building deep learning-based models is to adequately represent drugs and proteins that encompass the fundamental local chemical environments and long-distance information among amino acids of proteins (or atoms of drugs). Another challenge is to efficiently model the intermolecular interactions between drugs and proteins, which plays vital roles in the DTIs. To this end, we propose a novel model, GIFDTI, which consists of three key components: the sequence feature extractor (CNNFormer), the global molecular feature extractor (GF), and the intermolecular interaction modeling module (IIF). Specifically, CNNFormer incorporates CNN and Transformer to capture the local patterns and encode the long-distance relationship among tokens (atoms or amino acids) in a sequence. Then, GF and IIF extract the global molecular features and the intermolecular interaction features, respectively. We evaluate GIFDTI on six realistic evaluation strategies and the results show it improves DTI prediction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, case studies confirm that our model can be a useful tool to accurately yield low-cost DTIs.

SAG-DTA: Prediction of Drug-Target Affinity Using Self-Attention Graph Network.,34445696,"The prediction of drug-target affinity (DTA) is a crucial step for drug screening and discovery. In this study, a new graph-based prediction model named SAG-DTA (self-attention graph drug-target affinity) was implemented.

Features of each atom node in the molecular graph were weighted using an attention score before being aggregated as molecule representation. Various self-attention scoring methods were compared in this study.

Toxicity prediction using target,37061207,"In silico methods are essential to the safety evaluation of chemicals. Computational risk assessment offers several approaches, with data science and knowledge-based methods becoming an increasingly important sub-group. One of the substantial attributes of data science is that it allows using existing data to find correlations, build strong hypotheses, and create new, valuable knowledge that may help to reduce the number of resource intensive experiments. In choosing a suitable method for toxicity prediction, the available data and desired toxicity endpoint are two essential factors to consider. The complexity of the endpoint can impact the success rate of the in silico models. For highly complex endpoints such as hepatotoxicity, it can be beneficial to decipher the toxic event from a more systemic point of view. We propose a data science-based modelling pipeline that uses compounds` connections to tissue-specific biological targets, interactome, and biological pathways as descriptors of compounds. Models trained on different combinations of the collected, compound-target, compound-interactor, and compound-pathway profiles, were used to predict the hepatotoxicity of drug-like compounds. Several tree-based models were trained, utilizing separate and combined target, interactome and pathway level variables. The model using combined descriptors of all levels and the random forest algorithm was further optimized. Descriptor importance for model performance was addressed and examined for a biological explanation to define which targets or pathways can have a crucial role in toxicity. Descriptors connected to cytochromes P450 enzymes, heme degradation and biological oxidation received high weights. Furthermore, the involvement of other, less discussed processes in connection with toxicity, such as the involvement of RHO GTPase effectors in hepatotoxicity, were marked as fundamental. The optimized combined model using only the selected descriptors yielded the best performance with an accuracy of 0.766. The same dataset using classical Morgan fingerprints for compound representation yielded models with similar performance measures, as well as the combination of systems biology-based descriptors and Morgan fingerprints.

A deep learning method for drug-target affinity prediction based on sequence interaction information mining.,38099302,"A critical aspect of <i>in silico</i> drug discovery involves the prediction of drug-target affinity (DTA). Conducting wet lab experiments to determine affinity is both expensive and time-consuming, making it necessary to find alternative approaches. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a promising technique for DTA prediction, leveraging the substantial computational power of modern computers. We proposed a novel sequence-based approach, named KC-DTA, for predicting drug-target affinity (DTA). In this approach, we converted the target sequence into two distinct matrices, while representing the molecule compound as a graph. The proposed method utilized k-mers analysis and Cartesian product calculation to capture the interactions and evolutionary information among various residues, enabling the creation of the two matrices for target sequence. For molecule, it was represented by constructing a molecular graph where atoms serve as nodes and chemical bonds serve as edges. Subsequently, the obtained target matrices and molecule graph were utilized as inputs for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) to extract hidden features, which were further used for the prediction of binding affinity. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted several experiments and made a comprehensive comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches using multiple evaluation metrics. The results of our experiments demonstrated that the KC-DTA method achieves high performance in predicting drug-target affinity (DTA).

Prediction of drug protein interactions based on variable scale characteristic pyramid convolution network.,36804213,"In the process of drug screening, it is significant to improve the accuracy of drug-target binding affinity prediction.

However, the semantic information contained in low-level features can gradually be lost due to the increasing network depth, which affects the prediction performance.

How to approach machine learning-based prediction of drug/compound-target interactions.,36747300,"The identification of drug/compound-target interactions (DTIs) constitutes the basis of drug discovery, for which computational predictive approaches have been developed. As a relatively new data-driven paradigm, proteochemometric (PCM) modeling utilizes both protein and compound properties as a pair at the input level and processes them via statistical/machine learning. The representation of input samples (i.e., proteins and their ligands) in the form of quantitative feature vectors is crucial for the extraction of interaction-related properties during the artificial learning and subsequent prediction of DTIs. Lately, the representation learning approach, in which input samples are automatically featurized via training and applying a machine/deep learning model, has been utilized in biomedical sciences. In this study, we performed a comprehensive investigation of different computational approaches/techniques for protein featurization (including both conventional approaches and the novel learned embeddings), data preparation and exploration, machine learning-based modeling, and performance evaluation with the aim of achieving better data representations and more successful learning in DTI prediction. For this, we first constructed realistic and challenging benchmark datasets on small, medium, and large scales to be used as reliable gold standards for specific DTI modeling tasks. We developed and applied a network analysis-based splitting strategy to divide datasets into structurally different training and test folds. Using these datasets together with various featurization methods, we trained and tested DTI prediction models and evaluated their performance from different angles. Our main findings can be summarized under 3 items: (i) random splitting of datasets into train and test folds leads to near-complete data memorization and produce highly over-optimistic results, as a result, should be avoided, (ii) learned protein sequence embeddings work well in DTI prediction and offer high potential, despite interaction-related properties (e.g., structures) of proteins are unused during their self-supervised model training, and (iii) during the learning process, PCM models tend to rely heavily on compound features while partially ignoring protein features, primarily due to the inherent bias in DTI data, indicating the requirement for new and unbiased datasets.

DTiGEMS+ integrates multiple drug-drug similarities and target-target similarities into the final heterogeneous graph construction after applying a similarity selection procedure as well as a similarity fusion algorithm.

Deciphering the pharmacological mechanisms of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi on oral leukoplakia by combining network pharmacology,35667260,"Oral leukoplakia (OLK), an uncharacterized pathological condition that occurs as a white patch in the oral mucosa, is the most common precancerous condition. Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (SBG) is a medicinal plant with a wide range of pharmacological effects. Increased evidence shows that SBG has potential therapeutic effects on OLK. However, the therapeutic mechanisms of SBG against OLK have not yet been completely elucidated. This study aimed to clarify the active components and multi-target mechanisms of SBG against OLK via network pharmacology, molecular docking and experimental evaluations. The active components and related targets of SBG were screened by the TCMSP database and Swiss Target Prediction database. Potential therapeutic targets of OLK were collected using the GeneCards and OMIM databases. Then, we established protein-protein interaction (PPI), compound-target-disease (C-T-D), and compound-target-pathway (C-T-P) networks by Cytoscape to identify the main components, core targets, and pharmacological pathways of SBG against OLK via applying data mining techniques and topological parameters. Metascape database was utilized for GO and KEGG pathway analysis. Molecular docking techniques were used to estimate the binding force between the components and the hub genes. Subsequently, a series of in vitro experiments, specifically CCK-8 assay, clone formation assay, wound healing assay, flow cytometry, RT-qPCR and western blotting were conducted for further verification. There were 25 active components and 31 related target genes in SBG against OLK. PPI analysis showed that Akt1, VEGFA, EGFR, HIF1A and PTGS2 shared the highest centrality among all target genes. KEGG pathway analysis found that PI3K-Akt signaling pathway may occupy core status in the anti-OLK system. Molecular docking results showed that the main active components of SBG had a strong binding affinity to the hub genes. In vitro experiments showed that the leading component baicalein may inhibit proliferation, block cells in the S phase, induce DOK cell apoptosis, and downregulate the mRNA expression of 5 hub genes by inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway activation. The most predominant component of SBG against OLK was baicalein and the key pathway was PI3K/Akt. The main components and hub genes had robust binding abilities.

KEGG pathway analysis found that PI3K-Akt signaling pathway may occupy core status in the anti-OLK system. Molecular docking results showed that the main active components of SBG had a strong binding affinity to the hub genes. In vitro experiments showed that the leading component baicalein may inhibit proliferation, block cells in the S phase, induce DOK cell apoptosis, and downregulate the mRNA expression of 5 hub genes by inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway activation. The most predominant component of SBG against OLK was baicalein and the key pathway was PI3K/Akt. The main components and hub genes had robust binding abilities. In vitro experiments showed that baicalein could inhibit the proliferation of DOK cells, induce apoptosis, block the cell cycle, and inhibit the mRNA expression level of the hub genes by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway."
Predicting Drug-Target Affinity by Learning Protein Knowledge From Biological Networks.,37018115,"Predicting drug-target affinity (DTA) is a crucial step in the process of drug discovery. Efficient and accurate prediction of DTA would greatly reduce the time and economic cost of new drug development, which has encouraged the emergence of a large number of deep learning-based DTA prediction methods. In terms of the representation of target proteins, current methods can be classified into 1D sequence- and 2D-protein graph-based methods. However, both two approaches focused only on the inherent properties of the target protein, but neglected the broad prior knowledge regarding protein interactions that have been clearly elucidated in past decades. Aiming at the above issue, this work presents an end-to-end DTA prediction method named MSF-DTA (Multi-Source Feature Fusion-based Drug-Target Affinity). The contributions can be summarized as follows. First, MSF-DTA adopts a novel ""neighboring feature""-based protein representation. Instead of utilizing only the inherent features of a target protein, MSF-DTA gathers additional information for the target protein from its biologically related ""neighboring"" proteins in PPI (i.e., protein-protein interaction) and SSN (i.e., sequence similarity) networks to get prior knowledge. Second, the representation was learned using an advanced graph pre-training framework, VGAE, which could not only gather node features but also learn topological connections, therefore contributing to a richer protein representation and benefiting the downstream DTA prediction task.

Affinity2Vec: drug-target binding affinity prediction through representation learning,35306525,"Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction plays a crucial role in drug repositioning and virtual drug screening.

The regression-based methods provide insight beyond the binary relationship. However, most of these methods require the three-dimensional (3D) structural information of targets which are still not generally available to the targets.

Here we propose Affinity2Vec, as a novel regression-based method that formulates the entire task as a graph-based problem. To develop this method, we constructed a weighted heterogeneous graph that integrates data from several sources, including drug-drug similarity, target-target similarity, and drug-target binding affinities. Affinity2Vec further combines several computational techniques from feature representation learning, graph mining, and machine learning to generate or extract features, build the model, and predict the binding affinity between the drug and the target with no 3D structural data.

Our framework ensures that the known types of nodes (e.g., drug, target, side effects, diseases) are precisely embedded into high-dimensional space with our pretraining skills. Also, the attention-based heterogeneous graph-based matrix completion achieves highly competitive results via effective long-range dependencies extraction. We verify our model on two public benchmarks. The result of two publicly available benchmark application programs show that the proposed scheme effectively predicts drug-target interactions and can generalize to newly registered drugs and targets with slight performance degradation, outperforming the best accuracy compared with other baselines."
PPDTS: Predicting potential drug-target interactions based on network similarity.,34783172,"Identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) has great practical importance in the drug discovery process for known diseases. However, only a small proportion of DTIs in these databases has been verified experimentally, and the computational methods for predicting the interactions remain challenging. As a result, some effective computational models have become increasingly popular for predicting DTIs. In this work, the authors predict potential DTIs from the local structure of drug-target associations' network, which is different from the traditional global network similarity methods based on structure and ligand. A novel method called PPDTS is proposed to predict DTIs. First, according to the DTIs' network local structure, the known DTIs are converted into a binary network. Second, the Resource Allocation algorithm is used to obtain a drug-drug similarity network and a target-target similarity network. Third, a Collaborative Filtering algorithm is used with the known drug-target topology information to obtain similarity scores. Fourth, the linear combination of drug-target similarity model and the target-drug similarity model are innovatively proposed to obtain the final prediction results. Finally, the experimental performance of PPDTS has proved to be higher than that of the previously mentioned four popular network-based similarity methods, which is validated in different experimental datasets.

A Robust Drug-Target Interaction Prediction Framework with Capsule Network and Transfer Learning.,37762364,"Drug-target interactions (DTIs) are considered a crucial component of drug design and drug discovery. To date, many computational methods were developed for drug-target interactions, but they are insufficiently informative for accurately predicting DTIs due to the lack of experimentally verified negative datasets, inaccurate molecular feature representation, and ineffective DTI classifiers. Therefore, we address the limitations of randomly selecting negative DTI data from unknown drug-target pairs by establishing two experimentally validated datasets and propose a capsule network-based framework called CapBM-DTI to capture hierarchical relationships of drugs and targets, which adopts pre-trained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) for contextual sequence feature extraction from target proteins through transfer learning and the message-passing neural network (MPNN) for the 2-D graph feature extraction of compounds to accurately and robustly identify drug-target interactions. We compared the performance of CapBM-DTI with state-of-the-art methods using four experimentally validated DTI datasets of different sizes, including human (<i>Homo sapiens</i>) and worm (<i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>) species datasets, as well as three subsets (new compounds, new proteins, and new pairs).

NegStacking: Drug-Target Interaction Prediction Based on Ensemble Learning and Logistic Regression.,31985434,"Drug-target interactions (DTIs) identification is an important issue of drug research, and many methods proposed to predict potential DTIs based on machine learning treat it as a binary classification problem. However, the number of known interacting drug-target pairs (positive samples) is far less than that of non-interacting pairs (negative samples). Most methods do not utilize these large numbers of negative samples sufficiently, which limits their prediction performance. To address this problem, we proposed a stacking framework named NegStacking. First, it uses sampling to obtain multiple completely different negative sample sets. Then, each weak learner is trained with a different negative sample set and the same positive sample set, and the logistic regression (LR) is used as a meta-learner to adaptively combine these weak learners. Moreover, in the training process, feature subspacing and hyperparameter perturbation are applied to increase ensemble diversity. Finally, the trained model could be used to predict new samples. We compared NegStacking with other methods, and the experimental results show that our model is superior.

We employ the Lasso feature selection method, which lowers the dimensionality of feature vectors and speeds up the proposed model training time by more than 50%. The results from two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance. The mean squared errors of 18.8% and 23.19%, achieved on the KIBA and Davis datasets, respectively, suggest that our method is more accurate in predicting drug-target binding affinity."
Drug-target interaction prediction with tree-ensemble learning and output space reconstruction.,32033537,"Computational prediction of drug-target interactions (DTI) is vital for drug discovery.

Many machine learning approaches have been proposed over the years for DTI prediction. Nevertheless, prediction accuracy and efficiency are persisting problems that still need to be tackled. Here, we propose a new learning method which addresses DTI prediction as a multi-output prediction task by learning ensembles of multi-output bi-clustering trees (eBICT) on reconstructed networks. In our setting, the nodes of a DTI network (drugs and proteins) are represented by features (background information). The interactions between the nodes of a DTI network are modeled as an interaction matrix and compose the output space in our problem.

We performed an empirical evaluation, comparing the proposed approach to state of the art DTI prediction methods and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in different prediction settings.

Sequence-based prediction of protein binding regions and drug-target interactions.,35135622,"Identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) is important for drug discovery. However, searching all drug-target spaces poses a major bottleneck. Therefore, recently many deep learning models have been proposed to address this problem. However, the developers of these deep learning models have neglected interpretability in model construction, which is closely related to a model's performance. We hypothesized that training a model to predict important regions on a protein sequence would increase DTI prediction performance and provide a more interpretable model. Consequently, we constructed a deep learning model, named Highlights on Target Sequences (HoTS), which predicts binding regions (BRs) between a protein sequence and a drug ligand, as well as DTIs between them. To train the model, we collected complexes of protein-ligand interactions and protein sequences of binding sites and pretrained the model to predict BRs for a given protein sequence-ligand pair via object detection employing transformers. After pretraining the BR prediction, we trained the model to predict DTIs from a compound token designed to assign attention to BRs. We confirmed that training the BRs prediction model indeed improved the DTI prediction performance. The proposed HoTS model showed good performance in BR prediction on independent test datasets even though it does not use 3D structure information in its prediction. Furthermore, the HoTS model achieved the best performance in DTI prediction on test datasets.

Multitype Perception Method for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction.,37314917,"With the growing popularity of artificial intelligence in drug discovery, many deep-learning technologies have been used to automatically predict unknown drug-target interactions (DTIs). A unique challenge in using these technologies to predict DTI is fully exploiting the knowledge diversity across different interaction types, such as drug-drug, drug-target, drug-enzyme, drug-path, and drug-structure types. Unfortunately, existing methods tend to learn the specifical knowledge on each interaction type and they usually ignore the knowledge diversity across different interaction types. Therefore, we propose a multitype perception method (MPM) for DTI prediction by exploiting knowledge diversity across different link types. The method consists of two main components: a type perceptor and a multitype predictor. The type perceptor learns distinguished edge representations by retaining the specifical features across different interaction types; this maximizes the prediction performance for each interaction type. The multitype predictor calculates the type similarity between the type perceptor and predicted interactions, and the domain gate module is reconstructed to assign an adaptive weight to each type perceptor.

Counterfactual explanation is one popular approach to explaining the behaviour of a deep neural network, which works by systematically answering the question ""How would the model output change if the inputs were changed in this way?"". We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, Multi-Agent Counterfactual Drug-target binding Affinity (MACDA), to generate counterfactual explanations for the drug-protein complex. Our proposed framework provides human-interpretable counterfactual instances while optimizing both the input drug and target for counterfactual generation at the same time. We benchmark the proposed MACDA framework using the Davis and PDBBind dataset and find that our framework produces more parsimonious explanations with no loss in explanation validity, as measured by encoding similarity. We then present a case study involving ABL1 and Nilotinib to demonstrate how MACDA can explain the behaviour of a DTA model in the underlying substructure interaction between inputs in its prediction, revealing mechanisms that align with prior domain knowledge."
