32307268,"Active constituents and mechanisms of Respiratory Detox Shot, a traditional Chinese medicine prescription, for COVID-19 control and prevention: Network-molecular docking-LC-MS<sup>E</sup> analysis.. Lung-toxin Dispelling Formula No. 1, referred to as Respiratory Detox Shot (RDS), was developed based on a classical prescription of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and the theoretical understanding of herbal properties within TCM. Therapeutic benefits of using RDS for both disease
control and prevention, in the effort to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have been shown. However, the biochemically active constituents of RDS and their mechanisms of action are still unclear. The goal of the present study is to clarify the material foundation and action mechanism
of RDS. To conduct an analysis of RDS, an integrative analytical platform was constructed, including target prediction, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and cluster analysis; further, the hub genes involved in the disease-related pathways were identified, and the their corresponding
compounds were used for in vitro validation of molecular docking predictions. The presence of these validated compounds was also measured in samples of the RDS formula to quantify the abundance of the biochemically active constituents. In our network pharmacological study, a total of 26
bioinformatic programs and databases were used, and six networks, covering the entire Zang-fu viscera, were constructed to comprehensively analyze the intricate connections among the compounds-targets-disease pathways-meridians of RDS. For all 1071 known chemical constituents of the nine ingredients
in RDS, identified from established TCM databases, 157 passed drug-likeness screening and led to 339 predicted targets in the constituent-target network. Forty-two hub genes with core regulatory effects were extracted from the PPI network, and 134 compounds and 29 crucial disease pathways were
implicated in the target-constituent-disease network. Twelve disease pathways attributed to the Lung-Large Intestine meridians, with six and five attributed to the Kidney-Urinary Bladder and Stomach-Spleen meridians, respectively. One-hundred and eighteen candidate constituents showed a high binding
affinity with SARS-coronavirus-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL<sup>pro</sup>), as indicated by molecular docking using computational pattern recognition. The in vitro activity of 22 chemical constituents of RDS was validated using the 3CL<sup>pro</sup> inhibition assay. Finally, using liquid
chromatography mass spectrometry in data-independent analysis mode, the presence of seven out of these 22 constituents was confirmed and validated in an aqueous decoction of RDS, using reference standards in both non-targeted and targeted approaches. RDS acts primarily in the Lung-Large Intestine,
Kidney-Urinary Bladder and Stomach-Spleen meridians, with other Zang-fu viscera strategically covered by all nine ingredients. In the context of TCM meridian theory, the multiple components and targets of RDS contribute to RDS's dual effects of health-strengthening and pathogen-eliminating. This
results in general therapeutic effects for early COVID-19 control and prevention.",1
31993067,"GANsDTA: Predicting Drug-Target Binding Affinity Using GANs.. The computational prediction of interactions between drugs and targets is a standing challenge in drug discovery. State-of-the-art methods for drug-target interaction prediction are primarily based on supervised machine learning with known label information. However, in biomedicine,
obtaining labeled training data is an expensive and a laborious process. This paper proposes a semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (GANs)-based method to predict binding affinity. Our method comprises two parts, two GANs for feature extraction and a regression network for prediction. The
semi-supervised mechanism allows our model to learn proteins drugs features of both labeled and unlabeled data. We evaluate the performance of our method using multiple public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while utilizing freely available
unlabeled data. Our results suggest that utilizing such unlabeled data can considerably help improve performance in various biomedical relation extraction processes, for example, Drug-Target interaction and protein-protein interaction, particularly when only limited labeled data are available in
such tasks. To our best knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised GANs-based method to predict binding affinity.",0

To investigate the synergistic effects of Chuanxiong-Chishao herb-pair (CCHP) on promoting angiogenesis in silico and in vivo. The mechanisms of action of an herb-pair, Chuanxiong-Chishao, were investigated using the network pharmacological and pharmacodynamic strategies involving
computational drug target prediction and network analysis, and experimental validation. A set of network pharmacology methods were created to study the herbs in the context of targets and diseases networks, including prediction of target profiles and pharmacological actions of main active compounds
in Chuanxiong and Chishao. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects and putative molecular mechanisms of Chuanxiong-Chishao actions were experimentally validated in a chemical-induced vascular insuffificiency model of transgenic zebrafifish in vivo. The mRNA expression of the predicted targets were
further analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The computational prediction results found that the compounds in Chuanxiong have antithrombotic, antihypertensive, antiarrhythmic, and antiatherosclerotic activities, which were closely related to protecting against hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction and heart failure. In addition, compounds in Chishao were found to participate in anti-inflflammatory effect and analgesics. Particularly, estrogen receptor α (ESRα) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α) were the most important potential
protein targets in the predicted results. In vivo experimental validation showed that post-treatment of tetramethylpyrazine hydrochloride (TMP•HCl) and paeoniflorin (PF) promoted the regeneration of new blood vessels in zebrafifish involving up-regulating ESRα mRNA expression. Co-treatment of
TMP•HCl and PF could enhance the vessel sprouting in chemical-induced vascular insuffificiency zebrafifish at the optimal compatibility proportion of PF 10 μmol/L with TMP•HCl 1 μmol/L. The network pharmacological strategies combining drug target prediction and network analysis identified some
putative targets of CCHP. Moreover, the transgenic zebrafifish experiments demonstrated that the Chuanxiong-Chishao combination synergistically promoted angiogenic activity, probably involving ESRα signaling pathway.",1
35043158,"Drug-target interactions prediction via deep collaborative filtering with multiembeddings.. Drug-target interactions (DTIs) prediction research presents important significance for promoting the development of modern medicine and pharmacology. Traditional biochemical experiments for DTIs prediction confront the challenges including long time period, high cost and high failure
rate, and finally leading to a low-drug productivity. Chemogenomic-based computational methods can realize high-throughput prediction. In this study, we develop a deep collaborative filtering prediction model with multiembeddings, named DCFME (deep collaborative filtering prediction model with
multiembeddings), which can jointly utilize multiple feature information from multiembeddings. Two different representation learning algorithms are first employed to extract heterogeneous network features. DCFME uses the generated low-dimensional dense vectors as input, and then simulates the
drug-target relationship from the perspective of both couplings and heterogeneity. In addition, the model employs focal loss that concentrates the loss on sparse and hard samples in the training process. Comparative experiments with five baseline methods show that DCFME achieves more significant
performance improvement on sparse datasets. Moreover, the model has better robustness and generalization capacity under several harder prediction scenarios.",0
37730555,"Drug-target binding affinity prediction using message passing neural network and self supervised learning.. Drug-target binding affinity (DTA) prediction is important for the rapid development of drug discovery. Compared to traditional methods, deep learning methods provide a new way for DTA prediction to achieve good performance without much knowledge of the biochemical background. However,
there are still room for improvement in DTA prediction: (1) only focusing on the information of the atom leads to an incomplete representation of the molecular graph; (2) the self-supervised learning method could be introduced for protein representation. In this paper, a DTA prediction model using
the deep learning method is proposed, which uses an undirected-CMPNN for molecular embedding and combines CPCProt and MLM models for protein embedding. An attention mechanism is introduced to discover the important part of the protein sequence. The proposed method is evaluated on the datasets Ki and
Davis, and the model outperformed other deep learning methods. The proposed model improves the performance of the DTA prediction, which provides a novel strategy for deep learning-based virtual screening methods.",0
37524952,"Deep-learning-enabled protein-protein interaction analysis for prediction of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and variant evolution.. Host-pathogen interactions and pathogen evolution are underpinned by protein-protein interactions between viral and host proteins. An understanding of how viral variants affect protein-protein binding is important for predicting viral-host interactions, such as the emergence of new
pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here we propose an artificial intelligence-based framework called UniBind, in which proteins are represented as a graph at the residue and atom levels. UniBind integrates protein three-dimensional structure and binding affinity and is capable of multi-task learning
for heterogeneous biological data integration. In systematic tests on benchmark datasets and further experimental validation, UniBind effectively and scalably predicted the effects of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants on their binding affinities to the human ACE2 receptor, as well as to SARS-CoV-2
neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, in a cross-species analysis, UniBind could be applied to predict host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 variants and to predict future viral variant evolutionary trends. This in silico approach has the potential to serve as an early warning system for
problematic emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as to facilitate research on protein-protein interactions in general.",1
38139037,"Targeting Cathepsin L in Cancer Management: Leveraging Machine Learning, Structure-Based Virtual Screening, and Molecular Dynamics Studies.. Cathepsin L (CTSL) expression is dysregulated in a variety of cancers. Extensive empirical evidence indicates their direct participation in cancer growth, angiogenic processes, metastatic dissemination, and the development of treatment resistance. Currently, no natural CTSL inhibitors are
approved for clinical use. Consequently, the development of novel CTSL inhibition strategies is an urgent necessity. In this study, a combined machine learning (ML) and structure-based virtual screening strategy was employed to identify potential natural CTSL inhibitors. The random forest ML model
was trained on IC<sub>50</sub> values. The accuracy of the trained model was over 90%. Furthermore, we used this ML model to screen the Biopurify and Targetmol natural compound libraries, yielding 149 hits with prediction scores >0.6. These hits were subsequently selected for virtual screening using
a structure-based approach, yielding 13 hits with higher binding affinity compared to the positive control (AZ12878478). Two of these hits, ZINC4097985 and ZINC4098355, have been shown to strongly bind CTSL proteins. In addition to drug-like properties, both compounds demonstrated high affinity,
ligand efficiency, and specificity for the CTSL binding pocket. Furthermore, in molecular dynamics simulations spanning 200 ns, these compounds formed stable protein-ligand complexes. ZINC4097985 and ZINC4098355 can be considered promising candidates for CTSL inhibition after experimental
validation, with the potential to provide therapeutic benefits in cancer management.",0
31386888,"Prediction of the mechanisms of action of Shenkang in chronic kidney disease: A network pharmacology study and experimental validation.. Traditional Chinese medicine provides a unique curative treatment of complex chronic diseases, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is not effectively treated with the current therapies. The pharmacological mechanisms of Shenkang (SK), a herbal medicine containing rhubarb (Rheum
palmatum L. or R. tanguticum Maxim. ex Balf.), red sage (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge), safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.), and astragalus (Astragalus mongholicus Bunge), widely used to treat CKD in China, are still unclear. In this study, the comprehensive approach used for elucidating the
pharmacological mechanisms of SK included the identification of the effective constituents, target prediction and network analysis, by investigating the interacting pathways between these molecules in the context of CKD. These results were validated by performing an in vivo study and by comparison
with literature reviews. This approach involved the following main steps: first, we constructed a molecular database for SK and screened for active molecules by conducting drug-likeness and drug half-life evaluations; second, we used a weighted ensemble similarity drug-targeting model to accurately
identify the direct drug targets of the bioactive constituents; third, we constructed compound-target, target-pathway, and target-disease networks using the Cytoscape 3.2 software and determined the distribution of the targets in tissues and organs according to the BioGPS database. Finally, the
resulting drug-target mechanisms were compared with those proposed by previous research on SK and validated in a mouse model of CKD. By using Network analysis, 88 potential bioactive compounds in the four component herbs of SK and 85 CKD-related targets were identified, including pathways that
involve the nuclear factor-κB, mitogen-activated protein kinase, transient receptor potential, and vascular endothelial growth factor, which were categorized as inflammation, proliferation, migration, and permeability modules. The results also included different tissues (kidneys, liver, lungs, and
heart) and different disease types (urogenital, metabolic, endocrine, cardiovascular, and immune diseases as well as pathological processes) closely related to CKD. These findings agreed with those reported in the literature. However, our findings with the network pharmacology prediction did not
account for all the effects reported for SK found in the literature, such as regulation of the hemodynamics, inhibition of oxidative stress and apoptosis, and the involvement of the transforming growth factor-β/SMAD3, sirtuin/forkhead box protein O (SIRT/FOXO) and B-cell lymphoma-2-associated X
protein pathways. The in vivo validation experiment revealed that SK ameliorated CKD through antifibrosis and anti-inflammatory effects, by downregulating the levels of vascular cell adhesion protein 1, vitamin D receptor, cyclooxygenase-2, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 proteins in the unilateral
ureteral obstruction mouse model. This was consistent with the predicted target and pathway networks. SK exerted a curative effect on CKD and CKD-related diseases by targeting different organs, regulating inflammation and proliferation processes, and inhibiting abnormal extracellular matrix
accumulation. Thus, pharmacological network analysis with in vivo validation explained the potential effects and mechanisms of SK in the treatment of CKD. However, these findings need to be further confirmed with clinical studies.",1
38094882,"Computer-aided identification of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> resuscitation-promoting factor B (RpfB) inhibitors from <i>Gymnema sylvestre</i> natural products.. Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by multi-drug resistant <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb), has been a global health concern. Mtb affects over a third of the world's population, causing two million deaths annually due to its dormancy and propensity to spread infection
during this period. Resuscitation-promoting factor B (RpfB) plays a pivotal role in the growth of Mtb during dormant periods, making it a critical target for eliminating Mtb and curing TB. Gymnema sylvestre is a famous medicinal plant with several medicinal properties, including antimicrobial
activity; however, the therapeutic potential of the various reported metabolites of this plant against Mtb has not yet been explored. The aim of this study was to explore the reported natural products of <i>G</i>. <i>sylvestre</i> against the RpfB of the Mtb. A total of 131 reported secondary
metabolites of this plant were collected and virtually screened against the RpfB. We particularly targeted the Glu292 residue of RpfB as it is crucial for the catalysis of this protein. From our <i>in-house</i> library, 114 compounds showed a binding affinity higher than the standard drug. The
binding stability of the top three lead compounds was further confirmed through MD simulation analysis. Drug likeness analyses indicated that the ten hits had zero violations of the Lipinski rule of five. In addition, analyses of pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and target prediction revealed that the
top compounds are devoid of toxicity and do not affect human proteins. Additionally, they reflect multifaceted approach as anti-TB agents. Our selected hits not only exhibit molecular properties favoring physiological compatibility but also exhibit properties enhancing their potential efficacy as
therapeutic candidates. The compounds investigated here are worthy of experimental validation for the discovery of novel treatments against TB. Further, this study also provides a promising avenue for research on the pharmacological potential of <i>G. sylvestre.</i>",0
37061207,"Toxicity prediction using target, interactome, and pathway profiles as descriptors.. In silico methods are essential to the safety evaluation of chemicals. Computational risk assessment offers several approaches, with data science and knowledge-based methods becoming an increasingly important sub-group. One of the substantial attributes of data science is that it allows
using existing data to find correlations, build strong hypotheses, and create new, valuable knowledge that may help to reduce the number of resource intensive experiments. In choosing a suitable method for toxicity prediction, the available data and desired toxicity endpoint are two essential
factors to consider. The complexity of the endpoint can impact the success rate of the in silico models. For highly complex endpoints such as hepatotoxicity, it can be beneficial to decipher the toxic event from a more systemic point of view. We propose a data science-based modelling pipeline that
uses compounds` connections to tissue-specific biological targets, interactome, and biological pathways as descriptors of compounds. Models trained on different combinations of the collected, compound-target, compound-interactor, and compound-pathway profiles, were used to predict the hepatotoxicity
of drug-like compounds. Several tree-based models were trained, utilizing separate and combined target, interactome and pathway level variables. The model using combined descriptors of all levels and the random forest algorithm was further optimized. Descriptor importance for model performance was
addressed and examined for a biological explanation to define which targets or pathways can have a crucial role in toxicity. Descriptors connected to cytochromes P450 enzymes, heme degradation and biological oxidation received high weights. Furthermore, the involvement of other, less discussed
processes in connection with toxicity, such as the involvement of RHO GTPase effectors in hepatotoxicity, were marked as fundamental. The optimized combined model using only the selected descriptors yielded the best performance with an accuracy of 0.766. The same dataset using classical Morgan
fingerprints for compound representation yielded models with similar performance measures, as well as the combination of systems biology-based descriptors and Morgan fingerprints. Consequently, adding the structural information of compounds did not enhance the predictive value of the models. The
developed systems biology-based pipeline comprises a valuable tool in predicting toxicity, while providing novel insights about the possible mechanisms of the unwanted events.",0
37099690,"Improving drug-target affinity prediction via feature fusion and knowledge distillation.. Rapid and accurate prediction of drug-target affinity can accelerate and improve the drug discovery process. Recent studies show that deep learning models may have the potential to provide fast and accurate drug-target affinity prediction. However, the existing deep learning models still
have their own disadvantages that make it difficult to complete the task satisfactorily. Complex-based models rely heavily on the time-consuming docking process, and complex-free models lacks interpretability. In this study, we introduced a novel knowledge-distillation insights drug-target affinity
prediction model with feature fusion inputs to make fast, accurate and explainable predictions. We benchmarked the model on public affinity prediction and virtual screening dataset. The results show that it outperformed previous state-of-the-art models and achieved comparable performance to previous
complex-based models. Finally, we study the interpretability of this model through visualization and find it can provide meaningful explanations for pairwise interaction. We believe this model can further improve the drug-target affinity prediction for its higher accuracy and reliable
interpretability.",0
25820382,"Uncovering pharmacological mechanisms of Wu-tou decoction acting on rheumatoid arthritis through systems approaches: drug-target prediction, network analysis and experimental validation.. Wu-tou decoction (WTD) has been extensively used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Due to lack of appropriate methods, pharmacological mechanisms of WTD acting on RA have not been fully elucidated. In this study, a list of putative targets for compositive compounds containing
in WTD were predicted by drugCIPHER-CS. Then, the interaction network of the putative targets of WTD and known RA-related targets was constructed and hub nodes were identified. After constructing the interaction network of hubs, four topological features of each hub, including degree, node
betweenness, closeness and k-coreness, were calculated and 79 major hubs were identified as candidate targets of WTD, which were implicated into the imbalance of the nervous, endocrine and immune (NEI) systems, leading to the main pathological changes during the RA progression. Further experimental
validation also demonstrated the preventive effects of WTD on inflammation and joint destruction in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats and its regulatory effects on candidate targets both in vitro and in vivo systems. In conclusion, we performed an integrative analysis to offer the convincing
evidence that WTD may attenuate RA partially by restoring the balance of NEI system and subsequently reversing the pathological events during RA progression.",1
28932628,"A novel <i>in silico</i> framework to improve MHC-I epitopes and break the tolerance to melanoma.. Tolerance toward tumor antigens, which are shared by normal tissues, have often limited the efficacy of cancer vaccines. However, wild type epitopes can be tweaked to activate cross-reactive T-cell clones, resulting in antitumor activity. The design of these analogs (i.e., heteroclitic
peptides) can be difficult and time-consuming since no automated <i>in silico</i> tools are available. Hereby we describe the development of an <i>in silico</i> framework to improve the selection of heteroclitic peptides. The Epitope Discovery and Improvement System (EDIS) was first validated by
studying the model antigen SIINFEKL. Based on artificial neural network (ANN) predictions, we selected two mutant analogs that are characterized by an increased MHC-I binding affinity (SIINF<b>A</b>KL) or increased TCR stimulation (SII<b>W</b>FEKL). Therapeutic vaccination using optimized peptides
resulted in enhanced antitumor activity and against B16.OVA melanomas <i>in vivo</i>. The translational potential of the EDIS platform was further demonstrated by studying the melanoma-associated antigen tyrosinase related protein 2 (TRP2). Following therapeutic immunization with the EDIS-derived
epitope SVYDFF<b>A</b>WL, a significant reduction in the growth of established B16.F10 tumors was observed, suggesting a break in the tolerance toward the wild type epitope. Finally, we tested a multi vaccine approach, demonstrating that combination of wild type and mutant epitopes targeting both
TRP2 and OVA antigens increases the antitumor response. In conclusion, by taking advantage of available prediction servers and molecular dynamics simulations, we generated an innovative platform for studying the initial sequences and selecting lead candidates with improved immunological features.
Taken together, EDIS is the first automated algorithm-driven platform to speed up the design of heteroclitic peptides that can be publicly queried online.",1
35405857,"Boar Sperm Cryopreservation Improvement Using Semen Extender Modification by Dextran and Pentaisomaltose.. The long-term storage of boar sperm presents an ongoing challenge, and the modification of the cryoprotective compounds in semen extenders is crucial for improving cryopreservation's success rate. The aim of our study was to reduce the percentage of glycerol in the extender by elimination
or substitution with biocompatible, non-toxic polysaccharides. For boar semen extender improvement, we tested a novel modification with the polysaccharides dextran and pentaisomaltose in combination with unique in silico predictive modeling. We targeted the analysis of in vitro qualitative sperm
parameters such as motility, viability, mitochondrial activity, acrosome integrity, and DNA integrity. Non-penetrating polysaccharide-based cryoprotective agents interact with sperm surface proteins such as spermadhesins, which are recognized as fertility markers of boar sperm quality. The in silico
docking study showed a moderate binding affinity of dextran and pentaisomaltose toward one specific spermadhesin known as AWN, which is located in the sperm plasma membrane. Pentaisomaltose formed a hydrophobic pocket for the AWN protein, and the higher energy of this protein-ligand complex compared
with dextran was calculated. In addition, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) analysis for the molecular dynamics (MD) of both polysaccharides and AWN simulation suggests their interaction was highly stable. The in silico results were supported by in vitro experiments. In the experimental groups
where glycerol was partially or entirely substituted, the use of pentaisomaltose resulted in improved sperm mitochondrial activity and DNA integrity after thawing when compared with dextran. In this paper, we demonstrate that pentaisomaltose, previously used for cryopreservation in hematopoietic
stem cells, represents a promising compound for the elimination or reduction of glycerol in extenders for boar semen cryopreservation. This novel approach, using in silico computer prediction and in vitro testing, represents a promising technique to help identify new cryoprotectants for use in

36748577,"An efficient CRISPR interference-based prediction method for synergistic/additive effects of novel combinations of anti-tuberculosis drugs.. Tuberculosis (TB) is treated by chemotherapy with multiple anti-TB drugs for a long period, spanning 6 months even in a standard course. In perspective, to prevent the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, novel drugs that act synergistically or additively in combination with major
anti-TB drugs and, if possible, shorten the duration of TB therapy are needed. However, their combinatorial effect cannot be predicted until the lead identification phase of the drug development. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) is a powerful genetic
tool that enables high-throughput screening of novel drug targets. The development of anti-TB drugs promises to be accelerated by CRISPRi. This study determined whether CRISPRi could be applicable for predictive screening of the combinatorial effect between major anti-TB drugs and an inhibitor of a
novel target. In the checkerboard assay, isoniazid killed <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> synergistically or additively in combinations with rifampicin or ethambutol, respectively. The susceptibility to rifampicin and ethambutol was increased by knockdown of <i>inhA</i>, which encodes a target
molecule of isoniazid. Additionally, knockdown of <i>rpoB</i>, which encodes a target molecule of rifampicin, increased the susceptibility to isoniazid and ethambutol, which act synergistically with rifampicin in the checkerboard assay. Moreover, CRISPRi could successfully predict the synergistic
action of cyclomarin A, a novel TB drug candidate, with isoniazid or rifampicin. These results demonstrate that CRISPRi is a useful tool not only for drug target exploration but also for screening the combinatorial effects of novel combinations of anti-TB drugs. This study provides a rationale for
anti-TB drug development using CRISPRi.",1

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is progressing rapidly, and poses significant threats to public health. A number of clinical practice results showed that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays a significant role for COVID-19 treatment. To explore the active components and
molecular mechanism of semen <i>armeniacae amarum</i> treating COVID-19 by network pharmacology and molecular docking technology. The active components and potential targets of semen <i>armeniacae amarum</i> were retrieved from traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology (TCMSP) database.
Coronavirus disease 2019-associated targets were collected in the GeneCards, TTD, OMIM and PubChem database. Compound target, compound-target pathway and medicine-ingredient-target disease networks were constructed by Cytoscape 3.8.0. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were drawn using the
STRING database and Cytoscape 3.8.0 software. David database was used for gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. The main active components were verified by AutoDock Vina 1.1.2 software. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung inflammation model in
Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice was constructed and treated with amygdalin to confirm effects of amygdalin on lung inflammation and its underlying mechanisms by western blot analyses and immunofluorescence. The network analysis revealed that nine key, active components regulated eight
targets (Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase SRC (SRC), interleukin 6 (IL6), mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HRAS proto-oncogene (HRAS), caspase-3
(CASP3)). Gene ontology and KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that semen <i>armeniacae amarum</i> plays a role in COVID-19 by modulating 94 biological processes, 13 molecular functions, 15 cellular components and 80 potential pathways. Molecular docking indicated that amygdalin had better binding
activity to key targets such as IL6, SRC, MAPK3, SARS coronavirus-2 3C-like protease (SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro) and SARS-CoV-2 angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). Experimental validation revealed that the lung pathological injury and inflammatory injury were significantly increased in the model group
and were improved in the amygdalin group. Amygdalin is a candidate compound for COVID-19 treatment by regulating IL6, SRC, MAPK1 EGFR and VEGFA to involve in PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, VEGF signalling pathway and MAPK signalling pathway. Meanwhile, amygdalin has a strong affinity for SARS-CoV-2

A sharp increase in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) threatens human health. Spontaneous mutation in essential gene confers an ability of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> resistance to anti-TB drugs. However, conventional laboratory strategies for identification and prediction of

35667260,"Deciphering the pharmacological mechanisms of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi on oral leukoplakia by combining network pharmacology, molecular docking and experimental evaluations.. Oral leukoplakia (OLK), an uncharacterized pathological condition that occurs as a white patch in the oral mucosa, is the most common precancerous condition. Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (SBG) is a medicinal plant with a wide range of pharmacological effects. Increased evidence shows
that SBG has potential therapeutic effects on OLK. However, the therapeutic mechanisms of SBG against OLK have not yet been completely elucidated. This study aimed to clarify the active components and multi-target mechanisms of SBG against OLK via network pharmacology, molecular docking and
experimental evaluations. The active components and related targets of SBG were screened by the TCMSP database and Swiss Target Prediction database. Potential therapeutic targets of OLK were collected using the GeneCards and OMIM databases. Then, we established protein-protein interaction (PPI),
compound-target-disease (C-T-D), and compound-target-pathway (C-T-P) networks by Cytoscape to identify the main components, core targets, and pharmacological pathways of SBG against OLK via applying data mining techniques and topological parameters. Metascape database was utilized for GO and KEGG
pathway analysis. Molecular docking techniques were used to estimate the binding force between the components and the hub genes. Subsequently, a series of in vitro experiments, specifically CCK-8 assay, clone formation assay, wound healing assay, flow cytometry, RT-qPCR and western blotting were
conducted for further verification. There were 25 active components and 31 related target genes in SBG against OLK. PPI analysis showed that Akt1, VEGFA, EGFR, HIF1A and PTGS2 shared the highest centrality among all target genes. KEGG pathway analysis found that PI3K-Akt signaling pathway may occupy
core status in the anti-OLK system. Molecular docking results showed that the main active components of SBG had a strong binding affinity to the hub genes. In vitro experiments showed that the leading component baicalein may inhibit proliferation, block cells in the S phase, induce DOK cell
apoptosis, and downregulate the mRNA expression of 5 hub genes by inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway activation. The most predominant component of SBG against OLK was baicalein and the key pathway was PI3K/Akt. The main components and hub genes had robust binding abilities. In vitro experiments
showed that baicalein could inhibit the proliferation of DOK cells, induce apoptosis, block the cell cycle, and inhibit the mRNA expression level of the hub genes by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway.",1

56 plant compounds were evaluated for antimonekypox capabilities, with the top four candidates having a higher binding affinity than the control. We targeted the monkeypox profilin-like protein, which plays a key role in viral replication and assembly. Among the metabolites, curcumin showed the
strongest binding affinity with a value of -37.43 kcal/mol, followed by gedunin (-34.89 kcal/mol), piperine (-34.58 kcal/mol), and coumadin (-34.14 kcal/mol). Based on ADME and toxicity assessments, the top four substances had no negative impacts. Furthermore, four compounds demonstrated resistance
to deformability, which was corroborated by normal mode analysis. According to the bioactivity prediction study, the top compound target class was an enzyme, membrane receptor, and oxidoreductase. Furthermore, the study discovered that wortmannin, a gedunin analogue, can behave as an orthopoxvirus.

potentially be used as drug targets for melanoma treatment. The in silico single gene deletion step was adapted to simulate the knock-out of all targets of a drug on an objective function such as growth or energy balance. Based on publicly available, and in-house, large-scale transcriptomic data
metabolic models for melanoma were reconstructed enabling the prediction of 28 candidate drugs and estimating their respective efficacy. Twelve highly efficacious drugs with low half-maximal inhibitory concentration values for the treatment of other cancers, which are not yet approved for melanoma
treatment, were used for in vitro validation using melanoma cell lines. Combination of the top 4 out of 6 promising candidate drugs with BRAF or MEK inhibitors, partially showed synergistic growth inhibition compared to individual BRAF/MEK inhibition. Hence, the repurposing of drugs may enable an
increase in therapeutic options e.g., for non-responders or upon acquired resistance to conventional melanoma treatments.",1
37206617,"Network-based drug repurposing for potential stroke therapy.. Stroke is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with a growing number of incidences in developing countries. However, there are currently few medical therapies for this disease. Emerged as an effective drug discovery strategy, drug repurposing which owns lower cost and
shorter time, is able to identify new indications from existing drugs. In this study, we aimed at identifying potential drug candidates for stroke <i>via</i> computationally repurposing approved drugs from Drugbank database. We first developed a drug-target network of approved drugs, employed
network-based approach to repurpose these drugs, and altogether identified 185 drug candidates for stroke. To validate the prediction accuracy of our network-based approach, we next systematically searched for previous literature, and found 68 out of 185 drug candidates (36.8 %) exerted therapeutic
effects on stroke. We further selected several potential drug candidates with confirmed neuroprotective effects for testing their anti-stroke activity. Six drugs, including cinnarizine, orphenadrine, phenelzine, ketotifen, diclofenac and omeprazole, have exhibited good activity on oxygen-glucose
deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) induced BV2 cells. Finally, we showcased the anti-stroke mechanism of actions of cinnarizine and phenelzine <i>via</i> western blot and Olink inflammation panel. Experimental results revealed that they both played anti-stroke effects in the OGD/R induced BV2 cells
<i>via</i> inhibiting the expressions of IL-6 and COX-2. In summary, this study provides efficient network-based methodologies for <i>in silico</i> identification of drug candidates toward stroke.",1
37594752,"Dynamic applicability domain (dAD): compound-target binding affinity estimates with local conformal prediction.. Increasing efforts are being made in the field of machine learning to advance the learning of robust and accurate models from experimentally measured data and enable more efficient drug discovery processes. The prediction of binding affinity is one of the most frequent tasks of compound
bioactivity modelling. Learned models for binding affinity prediction are assessed by their average performance on unseen samples, but point predictions are typically not provided with a rigorous confidence assessment. Approaches, such as the conformal predictor framework equip conventional models
with a more rigorous assessment of confidence for individual point predictions. In this article, we extend the inductive conformal prediction framework for interaction data, in particular the compound-target binding affinity prediction task. The new framework is based on dynamically defined
calibration sets that are specific for each testing pair and provides prediction assessment in the context of calibration pairs from its compound-target neighbourhood, enabling improved estimates based on the local properties of the prediction model. The effectiveness of the approach is benchmarked
on several publicly available datasets and tested in realistic use-case scenarios with increasing levels of difficulty on a complex compound-target binding affinity space. We demonstrate that in such scenarios, novel approach combining applicability domain paradigm with conformal prediction
framework, produces superior confidence assessment with valid and more informative prediction regions compared to other 'state-of-the-art' conformal prediction approaches. Dataset and the code are available on GitHub (https://github.com/mlkr-rbi/dAD).",0

Currently, there are neither effective vaccines nor therapeutics available to prevent or treat ZIKV infection. In this study, to address these unmet medical needs, we aimed to design B- and T-cell
candidate multi-epitope-based subunit against ZIKV using an <i>in silico</i> approach. In this study we applied immunoinformatics, molecular docking, and dynamic simulation assessments targeting the most immunogenic proteins; the capsid (C), envelope (E) proteins and the non-stuctural protein (NS1),
described in our previous study, and which predicted immunodominant B and T cell epitopes. The final non-allergenic and highly antigenic multi-epitope was constituted of immunogenic screened-epitopes (3 CTL and 3 HTL) and the β-defensin as an adjuvant that have been linked using EAAAK, AAY, and
GPGPG linkers, respectively. The final construct containing 143 amino acids was characterized for its allergenicity, antigenicity, and physiochemical properties; and found to be safe and immunogenic with a good prediction of solubility. The existence of IFN-γ epitopes asserts the capacity to trigger
strong immune responses. Subsequently, the molecular docking among vaccine and immune receptors (TLR2/TLR4) was revealed with a good binding affinity with and stable molecular interactions. Molecular dynamics simulation confirmed the stability of the complexes. Finally, the construct was subjected
to <i>in silico</i> cloning demonstrating the efficiently of its expression in <i>E.coli.</i> However, this study needs the experimental validation to demonstrate vaccine safety and efficacy.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",0
36219223,"Computational Design and Experimental Validation of ACE2-Derived Peptides as SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain Inhibitors.. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant social and economic disruption across the globe. Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the human body is mediated via binding of the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) on the viral Spike protein (SARS-CoV-2 RBD) to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2)
expressed on host cells. Molecules that can disrupt ACE2:RBD interactions are attractive therapeutic candidates to prevent virus entry into human cells. A computational strategy that combines our Peptide Binding Design (PepBD) algorithm with atomistic molecular dynamics simulations was used to
design new inhibitory peptide candidates via sequence iteration starting with a 23-mer peptide, referred to as SBP1. SBP1 is derived from a region of the ACE2 Peptidase Domain α1 helix that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD of the initial Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. Three peptides demonstrated a solution-phase
RBD-binding dissociation constant in the micromolar range during tryptophan fluorescence quenching experiments, one peptide did not bind, and one was insoluble at micromolar concentrations. However, in competitive ELISA assays, none of these peptides could outcompete ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV-2-RBD
up to concentrations of 50 μM, similar to the parent SBP1 peptide which also failed to outcompete ACE2:RBD binding. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that P4 would have a good binding affinity for the RBD domain of Beta-B.1.351, Gamma-P.1, Kappa-B.1.617.1, Delta-B.1.617.2, and Omicron-B.1.1.529
variants, but not the Alpha variant. Consistent with this, P4 bound Kappa-B.1.617.1 and Delta-B.1.617.2 RBD with micromolar affinity in tryptophan fluorescence quenching experiments. Collectively, these data show that while relatively short unstructured peptides can bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with
moderate affinity, they are incapable of outcompeting the strong interactions between RBD and ACE2.",1

28787438,"Computational-experimental approach to drug-target interaction mapping: A case study on kinase inhibitors.. Due to relatively high costs and labor required for experimental profiling of the full target space of chemical compounds, various machine learning models have been proposed as cost-effective means to advance this process in terms of predicting the most potent compound-target interactions
for subsequent verification. However, most of the model predictions lack direct experimental validation in the laboratory, making their practical benefits for drug discovery or repurposing applications largely unknown. Here, we therefore introduce and carefully test a systematic
computational-experimental framework for the prediction and pre-clinical verification of drug-target interactions using a well-established kernel-based regression algorithm as the prediction model. To evaluate its performance, we first predicted unmeasured binding affinities in a large-scale kinase
inhibitor profiling study, and then experimentally tested 100 compound-kinase pairs. The relatively high correlation of 0.77 (p < 0.0001) between the predicted and measured bioactivities supports the potential of the model for filling the experimental gaps in existing compound-target interaction
maps. Further, we subjected the model to a more challenging task of predicting target interactions for such a new candidate drug compound that lacks prior binding profile information. As a specific case study, we used tivozanib, an investigational VEGF receptor inhibitor with currently unknown
off-target profile. Among 7 kinases with high predicted affinity, we experimentally validated 4 new off-targets of tivozanib, namely the Src-family kinases FRK and FYN A, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase ABL1, and the serine/threonine kinase SLK. Our sub-sequent experimental validation protocol
effectively avoids any possible information leakage between the training and validation data, and therefore enables rigorous model validation for practical applications. These results demonstrate that the kernel-based modeling approach offers practical benefits for probing novel insights into the
mode of action of investigational compounds, and for the identification of new target selectivities for drug repurposing applications.",1
38028215,"An integrated multi-pronged reverse vaccinology and biophysical approaches for identification of potential vaccine candidates against Nipah virus.. Nipah virus, a paramyxovirus linked to Hendra virus that first appeared in Malaysia and is the etiological agent of viral lethal encephalitis, has emerged as a strong threat to the health community in recent decades. Viral infections are seriously affecting global health. Since there are
now no efficient therapeutic options, it will take considerable effort to develop appropriate therapeutic management for the Nipah virus. The main purpose of this study was to design a messenger RNA-based multi-epitope vaccine construct against Nipah virus. This purpose was achieved through multiple
immunogenic epitopes prediction using Nipah virus antigenic protein using the immune epitope database and analysis resource (IEDB) followed by the vaccine construction and processing. As in multi-epitopes vaccine construction we selected immunogenic potential fragments of viral proteins, therefore
in host immune stimulation we observed proper immune responses toward a multi-epitopes vaccine. In this study, the Nipah virus V protein was used to identify immunodominant epitopes utilizing several reverse vaccinology, immunoinformatics and biophysical methods. The potential antigenic predicted
epitopes were further analyzed for immunoinformatics analysis and only selected probable antigenic and non-toxic epitopes were used in designing a multi-epitope mRNA based in silico vaccine against the target pathogen. In vaccine designing a total number of 03B cell epitopes, 09 Cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTLs) and 01 Helper T lymphocytes (HTL) were prioritized as a good vaccine candidate. In the vaccine construction phase, the selected epitopes were linked together using EAAAK, GPGPG, KK, and AAY linkers, and B-defensin (adjuvant), and MITD sequences were also added to the vaccine
construct to increase the potency. After vaccine construction, the physiochemical properties of the vaccine construct were evaluated which predicted that the vaccine construct comprises 320 amino acids with 34.29 kDa (kDa) molecular weight. The instability index was 36.55 proving its stability with
the aliphatic index of 82.88. Furthermore, 9.0 theoretical pI and -0.317, GRAVY (Grand Average of Hydropathy) values were predicted in physicochemical properties analysis. A solubility check was applied against the vaccine construct depicting that the vaccine construct is soluble with its calculated
value of 0.6. Additionally, after prediction the 3D structure was modeled and refined for docking analysis, the refined 3D structure of the vaccine candidate was further checked for binding affinity with immune cell receptors through docking analysis, in the docking analysis we observed that the
vaccine construct has a good binding affinity with immune cells receptor and can induce a proper immune response in host cells. As we predicted effective binding of the designed vaccine construct, hence it can further facilitate the development of vaccine formulation against the Nipah virus.
Additionally, molecular dynamic simulation was done using the AMBER v20 package for analysis of the dynamic behaviour of the docked complexes and we observed proper binding stability of the vaccine with target receptor. In C-immune simulation, different humoral and cellular antibody titer was
observed in response to the vaccine. Overall using bioinformatics, immunoinformatics, and biophysical approaches we observed that this mRNA base epitopes vaccine construct could facilitate the proof of concept for the formation of the experimental base vaccine against the Nipah virus, as the in
silico predictions indicated that the vaccine is highly promising in terms of developing protective immunity. However experimental validation is required to disclose the real immune-protective efficacy of the vaccine.",0

Brucea Javanica Oil Emulsion Injection (BJOEI) has been proven to have extensive anti-tumor effects. But the anti-cancer mechanisms need further exploration. So, the aim of this study was to investigate the role and mechanisms of BJOEI on pancreatic cancer using network pharmacology and
experimental validation. Disease targets were obtained from the GSE101448 dataset in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Eight active ingredients were identified following a comprehensive literature search. The target genes of BJOEI were obtained from the SwissTarget Prediction database. The
core targets of BJOEI and the involved signaling pathways were determined using the compound-target network, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of 50 potential
overlapping genes indicated that BJOEI exerted therapeutic effects on pancreatic cancer through the apoptotic pathway. <i>In vitro</i> experiments further revealed that BJOEI could suppress cell growth and invasion, arrest cells at the S stage, and cause cell apoptosis in three pancreatic cell
lines. Additionally, BJOEI inhibited tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>. Among the 15 key genes regulating apoptosis, 11 were upregulated, while 4 were downregulated. PPARG emerged as a core target in bioinformatics analysis. The ability of PPARG to regulate apoptosis was validated by Western Blot. Our
findings verified that BJOEI could regulate apoptosis-related genes, especially PPARG, thereby inducing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation in pancreatic cancer cells. BJOEI can impede pancreatic cancer progression and induce cell apoptosis. The underlying mechanism appears to be closely
associated with the regulation of apoptosis-related genes.",1

36619413,"Systems biology and <i>in silico</i>-based analysis of PCOS revealed the risk of metabolic disorders.. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition of hyperandrogenism, chronic ovulation, and polycystic ovaries in females during the reproduction and maturation of the ovum. Although PCOS has been associated with metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity (OBE),
and cardiovascular disease (CVD), Causal connection and molecular features are still unknown. Therefore, we investigated the shared common differentially expressed genes (DEGs), pathways, and networks of associated proteins in PCOS and metabolic diseases with therapeutic intervention. We have used a
bioinformatics pipeline to analyze transcriptome data for the polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity (OBE), and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in female patients. Then we employed gene-disease association network, gene ontology (GO) and signaling pathway analysis,
selection of hub genes from protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, molecular docking, and gold benchmarking approach to screen potential hub proteins. We discovered 2225 DEGs in PCOS patients relative to healthy controls and 34, 91, and 205 significant DEGs with T2D, Obesity, and CVD,
respectively. Gene Ontology analysis revealed several significant shared and metabolic pathways from signaling pathway analysis. Furthermore, we identified ten potential hub proteins from PPI analysis that may serve as a therapeutic intervention in the future. Finally, we targeted one significant
hub protein, IGF2R (PDB ID: 2V5O), out of ten hub proteins based on the Maximal clique centrality (MCC) algorithm and literature review for molecular docking study. Enzastaurin (-12.5), Kaempferol (-9.1), Quercetin (-9.0), and Coumestrol (-8.9) kcal/mol showed higher binding affinity in the

34555547,"Systematic analysis of chemical-protein interactions from zebrafish embryo by proteome-wide thermal shift assay, bridging the gap between molecular interactions and toxicity pathways.. The molecular interaction between chemicals and proteins often promotes alteration of cellular function. One of the challenges of the toxicology is to predict the impact of exposure to chemicals. Assessing the impact of exposure implies to understand their mechanism of actions starting
from identification of specific protein targets of the interaction. Current methods can mainly predict effects of characterized chemicals with knowledge of its targets, and mechanism of actions. Here, we show that proteome-wide thermal shift methods can identify chemical-protein interactions and the
protein targets from bioactive chemicals. We analyzed the identified targets from a soluble proteome extracted from zebrafish embryo, that is a model system for toxicology. To evaluate the utility to predict mechanism of actions, we discussed the applicability in four cases: single chemicals,
chemical mixtures, novel chemicals, and novel drugs. Our results showed that this methodology could identify the protein targets, discriminate between protein increasing and decreasing in solubility, and offering additional data to complement the map of intertwined mechanism of actions. We
anticipate that the proteome integral solubility alteration (PISA) assay, as it is defined here for the unbiased identification of protein targets of chemicals could bridge the gap between molecular interactions and toxicity pathways. SIGNIFICANCE: One of the challenges of the environmental
toxicology is to predict the impact of exposure to chemicals on environment and human health. Our phenotype should be explained by our genotype and the environmental exposure. Genomic methodologies can offer a deep analysis of human genome that alone cannot explain our risks of disease. We are
starting to understand the key role of exposure to chemicals on our health and risks of disease. Here, we present a proteomic-based method for the identification of soluble proteins interacting with chemicals in zebrafish embryo and discuss the opportunities to complement the map of toxicity pathway

35362839,"Design of an Epitope-Based Peptide Vaccine Against the Major Allergen Amb a 11 Using Immunoinformatic Approaches.. Allergic diseases are a socially significant problem of global importance. The number of people suffering from pollen allergies has increased dramatically in recent decades. Pollen allergies affect up to 30% of the world population. Pollen of the common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.)
is one of the most aggressive allergens in the world. We have used a series of immunoinformatics approaches to design an effective epitope-based vaccine, which might induce a competent immunity against a major allergen Amb a 11. CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitopes and their corresponding MHC restricted
alleles were identified by prediction tools provided by immune epitope database (IEDB). Among T-cell epitopes, MHC class I peptide (GLMEPAFTYV) and MHC class II peptide (LVCFSFSLVLILGLV) were identified as most suitable. From all predicted B-cell epitopes, only one epitope (GKLVKFSEQQLVDC)
containing sequence from the conserved region was chosen for next processing. Selected epitopes have been validated by molecular docking analysis. These epitopes showed a very strong binding affinity to MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule with binding energy scores - 729.3 and - 725.0 kcal/mole
respectively. Performed experimental validation showed that only the MHC class II peptide (LVCFSFSLVLILGLV) can stimulate T cells from ragweed allergic patients and IgE antibodies specific to the ragweed pollen do not recognize this epitope. Therefore, this peptide could be potentially used as a
vaccine against the major allergen Amb a 11. The B-cell epitope GKLVKFSEQQLVDC forms a stable complex with the IgE molecule (energy weighted score - 695,0 kcal/mole). Tested sera from patients with ragweed allergy showed that the ragweed specific IgE antibodies can bind to the identified B-cell
epitope. Population coverage analysis was performed for CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitopes. It was predicted that CD4+ T-cell epitope (LVCFSFSLVLILGLV) covers 90.56% of the population of Europe and 99.36% of the world population. CD8+ T-cell epitope (GLMEPAFTYV) has a population coverage of 77.37% for

35860733,"Network Pharmacology-Based Prediction and Pharmacological Validation of Effects of Astragali Radix on Acetaminophen-Induced Liver Injury.. Astragali Radix (AR) has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions for acute and chronic liver injury. However, little is known about the effects of AR on acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury (ALI). In the current study, a network pharmacology-based approach was
applied to characterize the action mechanism of AR on ALI. All compounds of AR were obtained from the corresponding databases, and active compounds were selected according to its oral bioavailability and drug-likeness index. The potential genes of AR were obtained from the Traditional Chinese
Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP), and the Bioinformatics Analysis Tool for Molecular Mechanism of Traditional Chinese Medicine (BATMAN-TCM) and PubChem, whereas the potential genes related to ALI were obtained from Online databases (GeneCards and Online Mendelian
Inheritance in Man) and Gene Expression Omnibus profiles. The enriched processes, pathways, and target genes of the diseases were analyzed by referring to the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database. A network constructed through Cytoscape software was used to identify
the target proteins that connected the compounds in AR with the differential genes of ALI. Subsequently, the potential underlying action mechanisms of AR on ALI predicted by the network pharmacology analyses were experimentally validated in APAP-induced liver injury in mice and HL7702 cells
incubated with APAP. The compound-target network included 181 targets, whereas the potential genes related to ALI were 4,621. A total of 49 AR-ALI crossover proteins, corresponding to 49 genes, were filtered into a protein-protein interaction network complex and designated as the potential targets
of AR on ALI. Among the genes, the three highest-scoring genes, <i>MYC</i>, <i>MAPK8</i>, and <i>CXCL8</i> were highly associated with apoptosis in ALI. Then <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments confirmed that AR exhibited its prominent therapeutic effects on ALI mainly via regulating
hepatocyte apoptosis related to inhibiting the expressions of <i>MYC</i> (c-Myc), <i>MAPK8</i> (JNK1), and <i>CXCL8</i> (IL-8). In conclusion, our study suggested that the combination of network pharmacology prediction with experimental validation might offer a useful tool to characterize the

36681052,"Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) as a potential candidate for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants: In silico prediction and experimental validation.. The high number of mutations and consequent structure modifications in a Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of the spike protein of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 increased concerns about evading neutralization by antibodies induced by previous infection or vaccination. Thus, developing
novel drugs with potent inhibitory activity can be considered an alternative for treating this highly transmissible variant. Considering that Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) displays antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, the potency of this lectin to inhibit the Receptor Binding Domain of the
Omicron variant (RBD<sup>Omic</sup>) was examined in this study. This study examines how UDA inhibits the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 by blocking its RBD, using a combination of in silico and experimental methods. To investigate the interaction between UDA and RBD<sup>Omic</sup>, the CLUSPRO 2.0
web server was used to dock the RBD<sup>Omic</sup>-UDA complex, and molecular dynamics simulations were performed by the Gromacs 2020.2 software to confirm the stability of the selected docked complex. Finally, the binding affinity (ΔG) of the simulation was calculated using MM-PBSA. In addition,
ELISA and Western blot tests were used to examine UDA's binding to RBD<sup>Omic</sup>. Based on the docking results, UDA forms five hydrogen bonds with the RBD<sup>Omic</sup> active site, which contains mutated residues Tyr501, Arg498, Arg493, and His505. According to MD simulations, the
UDA-RBD<sup>Omic</sup> complex is stable over 100 ns, and its average binding energy during the simulation is -87.201 kJ/mol. Also, the ELISA test showed that UDA significantly binds to RBD<sup>Omic</sup>, and by increasing the concentration of UDA protein, the attachment to RBD<sup>Omic</sup>
became stronger. In Western blotting, RBD<sup>Omic</sup> was able to attach to and detect UDA. This study indicates that UDA interaction with RBD<sup>Omic</sup> prevents virus attachment to Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and, therefore, its entry into the host cell. Altogether, UDA exhibited
a significant suppression effect on the Omicron variant and can be considered a new candidate to improve protection against severe infection of this variant.",1
31022582,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibition as a potential pharmacological target for vascular dementia: In silico and in vivo evidence.. Vascular dementia is a serious problem as it creates significant disability and dependency in the affected person. Lives of these patients can be improved through the advent of novel drug targets which can be targeted by pharmacological therapies. However, finding a precise and druggable
target for vascular dementia is experimentally impossible and challenging task owing to a complex and mostly unknown interplay between the cognitive abilities of the brain with a diversity of vascular diseases. To address this issue, we have systematically analyzed the literature reports by using
well-known methods and approaches of bioinformatics (viz. network pharmacology, reverse pharmacology, enrichment analysis of KEGG pathways, biological processes of Gene Ontology and DIAMOnD algorithm). Because glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) seems to be one of the most promising targets,
therefore, we have tested the capacity of lithium carbonate, a classical inhibitor of GSK-3, for treatment of dementia resulting from mild chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in mice. To this end, our study shows in-vivo validation of predicted target, i.e., pharmacological deactivation of GSK-3 enzyme
and its impact on cognitive abilities employing a behavioral test battery, i.e., object recognition task, step-through passive avoidance task, elevated plus maze task and water maze task. In this framework, we observed that lithium carbonate attenuates recognition, emotion, spatial and
fear-motivated learning and memory impairments along with attenuation of oxidative stress, cholinergic dysfunction and glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In conclusion, we propose GSK-3 as a promising drug target for vascular dementia in light of experimental
results and in-silico predictions.",1
35441904,"Immunoinformatics approach of epitope prediction for SARS-CoV-2.. The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) caused lethal infections worldwide during an unprecedented pandemic. Identification of the candidate viral epitopes is the first step in the design of vaccines against the viral infection. Several immunoinformatic approaches were employed to identify the
SARS-CoV-2 epitopes that bind specifically with the major histocompatibility molecules class I (MHC-I). We utilized immunoinformatic tools to analyze the whole viral protein sequences, to identify the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes responsible for binding to the most frequent human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
alleles in the Egyptian population. These alleles were also found with high frequency in other populations worldwide. Molecular docking approach showed that using the co-crystallized MHC-I and T cell receptor (TCR) instead of using MHC-I structure only, significantly enhanced docking scores and
stabilized the conformation, as well as the binding affinity of the identified SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Our approach directly predicts 7 potential vaccine subunits from the available SARS-CoV-2 spike and ORF1ab protein sequence. This prediction has been confirmed by published experimentally validated
and in silico predicted spike epitope. On the other hand, we predicted novel epitopes (RDLPQGFSA and FCLEASFNY) showing high docking scores and antigenicity response with both MHC-I and TCR. Moreover, antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, and physicochemical properties of the predicted SARS-CoV-2
epitopes were evaluated via state-of-the-art bioinformatic approaches, showing high efficacy of the proposed epitopes as a vaccine candidate. Our predicted SARS-CoV-2 epitopes can facilitate vaccine development to enhance the immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2 and provide supportive data for further

and relevant pathways were identified. Among them, two active ingredients, methylophiopogonone A and 8-geranyloxypsoralen, were validated as exhibiting antifibrotic effects on hepatic stellate cells. We identified the potential active ingredients of the YGJD and proposed the possible explanation for
the MOA in the treatment of CHB patients with liver fibrosis. Moreover, this study provides a methodological reference for the systematic investigation of the bioactive compounds and related MOA of a traditional Chinese medicine formula in a clinical context.",1
33116398,"Integrated Network Pharmacology Analysis and Experimental Validation to Reveal the Mechanism of Anti-Insulin Resistance Effects of <i>Moringa oleifera</i> Seeds.. Insulin resistance (IR) is one of the factors that results in metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus and different aspects of cardiovascular diseases. <i>Moringa oleifera</i> seeds (MOS), traditionally used as an antidiabetic food and traditional medicine in tropical Asia and Africa,
have exhibited potential effects in improving IR. To systematically explore the pharmacological mechanism of the anti-IR effects of MOS, we adopted a network pharmacology approach at the molecular level. By incorporating compound screening and target prediction, a feasible compound-target-pathway
network pharmacology model was established to systematically predict the potential active components and mechanisms of the anti-IR effects of MOS. Biological methods were then used to verify the results of the network pharmacology analysis. Our comprehensive systematic approach successfully
identified 32 bioactive compounds in MOS and 44 potential targets of these compounds related to IR, as well as 37 potential pathways related to IR. Moreover, the network pharmacology analysis revealed that glycosidic isothiocyanates and glycosidic benzylamines were the major active components that
improved IR by acting on key targets, such as SRC, PTPN1, and CASP3, which were involved in inflammatory responses and insulin-related pathways. Further biological research demonstrated that the anti-IR effects of MOS were mediated by increasing glucose uptake and modulating the expression of SRC
and PTPN1. Our study successfully predicts the active ingredients and potential targets of MOS for improving IR and helps to illustrate mechanism of action at a systemic level. This study not only provides new insights into the chemical basis and pharmacology of MOS but also demonstrates a feasible
method for discovering potential drugs from traditional medicines.",1
31945078,"Drug-target interaction prediction using Multi Graph Regularized Nuclear Norm Minimization.. The identification of potential interactions between drugs and target proteins is crucial in pharmaceutical sciences. The experimental validation of interactions in genomic drug discovery is laborious and expensive; hence, there is a need for efficient and accurate in-silico techniques
which can predict potential drug-target interactions to narrow down the search space for experimental verification. In this work, we propose a new framework, namely, Multi-Graph Regularized Nuclear Norm Minimization, which predicts the interactions between drugs and target proteins from three
inputs: known drug-target interaction network, similarities over drugs and those over targets. The proposed method focuses on finding a low-rank interaction matrix that is structured by the proximities of drugs and targets encoded by graphs. Previous works on Drug Target Interaction (DTI) prediction
have shown that incorporating drug and target similarities helps in learning the data manifold better by preserving the local geometries of the original data. But, there is no clear consensus on which kind and what combination of similarities would best assist the prediction task. Hence, we propose
to use various multiple drug-drug similarities and target-target similarities as multiple graph Laplacian (over drugs/targets) regularization terms to capture the proximities exhaustively. Extensive cross-validation experiments on four benchmark datasets using standard evaluation metrics (AUPR and
AUC) show that the proposed algorithm improves the predictive performance and outperforms recent state-of-the-art computational methods by a large margin. Software is publicly available at https://github.com/aanchalMongia/MGRNNMforDTI.",0
37314917,"Multitype Perception Method for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction.. With the growing popularity of artificial intelligence in drug discovery, many deep-learning technologies have been used to automatically predict unknown drug-target interactions (DTIs). A unique challenge in using these technologies to predict DTI is fully exploiting the knowledge
diversity across different interaction types, such as drug-drug, drug-target, drug-enzyme, drug-path, and drug-structure types. Unfortunately, existing methods tend to learn the specifical knowledge on each interaction type and they usually ignore the knowledge diversity across different interaction
types. Therefore, we propose a multitype perception method (MPM) for DTI prediction by exploiting knowledge diversity across different link types. The method consists of two main components: a type perceptor and a multitype predictor. The type perceptor learns distinguished edge representations by
retaining the specifical features across different interaction types; this maximizes the prediction performance for each interaction type. The multitype predictor calculates the type similarity between the type perceptor and predicted interactions, and the domain gate module is reconstructed to
assign an adaptive weight to each type perceptor. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed MPM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in DTI prediction.",0
33354218,"Integrating Network Pharmacology and Experimental Validation to Investigate the Mechanisms of Huazhuojiedu Decoction to Treat Chronic Atrophic Gastritis.. Chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) is an important stage in the normal gastric mucosa's transformation into gastric cancer. Huazhuojiedu decoction (HZJD), a Chinese herbal preparation, has proven clinically effective to treat CAG. However, few studies have explored the mechanism of HZJD in
CAG treatment. This study aimed to shed light on the mechanisms underlying HZJD decoction CAG treatment using a network pharmacology approach and experimental validation. The active components of HZJD decoction were obtained from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and
Analysis Platform. Their targets were predicted through the SwissTargetPrediction database. Disease targets were screened using the GeneCards database. The disease and drug prediction targets were intersected to select the common potential therapeutic targets, which then were input into the Search
Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes to build a protein-protein interaction network. The ""herb-compound-target-disease"" and the ""herb-target-pathway"" network diagrams were constructed in Cytoscape 3.3.0. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis of
effective targets were performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery. Finally, the core targets were preliminarily verified by CAG rat model. The gastric mucosa's histopathological changes were observed via hematoxylin-eosin staining. The expressions of MAPK1,
AKT1, TNF, VEGFA, and EGFR were detected by western blot and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. A total of 155 nodes, including 20 putative targets of HZJD decoction, were selected as core hubs based on topological importance and were closely associated with the
regulation of cell proliferation, apoptotic process, and cancer-related pathways (AKT1, TNF, VEGFA, and EGFR) in CAG. Further animal experiments showed that the expression of AKT1 in CAG rats was significantly increased, which was suppressed by HZJD decoction. TNF and VEGFA expression increased in
the model group, but did not change in the HZJD group. MAPK1 and EGFR expression showed no significant differences among control, model, and HZJD groups. Taken together, the results suggest that the components of HZJD decoction can alleviate and prevent the severity of gastric precancerous lesions

The importance of the main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) enzyme of SARS-CoV-2 in the digestion of viral polyproteins introduces M<sup>pro</sup> as an attractive drug target for antiviral drug design. This study aims to carry out the molecular docking, molecular dynamics studies, and
prediction of ADMET properties of selected potential antiviral molecules. The study provides an insight into biomolecular interactions to understand the inhibitory mechanism and the spatial orientation of the tested ligands and further, identification of key amino acid residues within the
substrate-binding pocket that can be applied for structure-based drug design. In this regard, we carried out molecular docking studies of chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir (RDV), GS441524, arbidol (ARB), and natural product glycyrrhizin (GA) using AutoDock 4.2 tool. To study the
drug-receptor complex's stability, selected docking possesses were further subjected to molecular dynamics studies with Schrodinger software. The prediction of ADMET/toxicity properties was carried out on ADMET Prediction™. The docking studies suggested a potential role played by CYS145, HIS163, and
GLU166 in the interaction of molecules within the active site of COVID-19 M<sup>pro</sup>. In the docking studies, RDV and GA exhibited superiority in binding with the crystal structure of M<sup>pro</sup> over the other selected molecules in this study. Spatial orientations of the molecules at the
active site of M<sup>pro</sup> exposed the significance of S1-S4 subsites and surrounding amino acid residues. Among GA and RDV, RDV showed better and stable interactions with the protein, which is the reason for the lesser RMSD values for RDV. Overall, the present in silico study indicated the

assay, compound <b>1d</b> exhibited the highest CDK9 inhibition with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.18 µM. The cytotoxicity effect of the novel compounds was evaluated in three cancer cell lines: HCT116, K652, and MCF7. The results of this assay showed a correlation between the antiproliferative effect of
the inhibitors and their CDK9 inhibitory effect in the biochemical assay. This suggests CDK9 inhibition as a mechanistic pathway for their anticancer effect. Several compounds demonstrated potent cytotoxic effects with single-digit micromolar IC<sub>50</sub> values yielded through an MTT assay. The

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) reactivation poses a substantial risk to transplant patients. Effective risk stratification and vaccine development is hampered by a lack of HCMV-derived immunogenic peptides in patients with common HLA-A*03:01 and HLA-B*15:01 haplotypes. This study aimed to
discover novel HCMV immunogenic peptides for these haplotypes by combining Ribo-seq and mass spectrometry with state-of-the-art computational tools, Peptide-PRISM and PRICE. Furthermore, employing machine learning, an algorithm was developed to predict immunogenicity based on translational activity,
binding affinity and peptide localization within small open reading frames to identify the most promising peptides for in vitro validation. Immunogenicity of these peptides was subsequently tested by analyzing peptide-specific T-cell responses of HCMV-seropositive and -seronegative healthy donors as
well as transplant patients. This resulted in the direct identification of three canonical and one cryptic HLA-A*03-restricted immunogenic peptides as well as five canonical and one cryptic HLA-B*15-restricted immunogenic peptide, with a specific IFNγ+/CD8+ T-cell response of ≥ 0.02%. High T-cell

33764050,"Estimating the Roles of Protonation and Electronic Polarization in Absolute Binding Affinity Simulations.. Accurate prediction of binding free energies is critical to streamlining the drug development and protein design process. With the advent of GPU acceleration, absolute alchemical methods, which simulate the removal of ligand electrostatics and van der Waals interactions with the protein,
have become routinely accessible and provide a physically rigorous approach that enables full consideration of flexibility and solvent interaction. However, standard explicit solvent simulations are unable to model protonation or electronic polarization changes upon ligand transfer from water to the
protein interior, leading to inaccurate prediction of binding affinities for charged molecules. Here, we perform extensive simulation totaling ∼540 μs to benchmark the impact of modeling conditions on predictive accuracy for absolute alchemical simulations. Binding to urokinase plasminogen activator
(UPA), a protein frequently overexpressed in metastatic tumors, is evaluated for a set of 10 inhibitors with extended flexibility, highly charged character, and titratable properties. We demonstrate that the alchemical simulations can be adapted to utilize the MBAR/PBSA method to improve the
accuracy upon incorporating electronic polarization, highlighting the importance of polarization in alchemical simulations of binding affinities. Comparison of binding energy prediction at various protonation states indicates that proper electrostatic setup is also crucial in binding affinity
prediction of charged systems, prompting us to propose an alternative binding mode with protonated ligand phenol and Hid-46 at the binding site, a testable hypothesis for future experimental validation.",0
34843456,"Protein domain-based prediction of drug/compound-target interactions and experimental validation on LIM kinases.. Predictive approaches such as virtual screening have been used in drug discovery with the objective of reducing developmental time and costs. Current machine learning and network-based approaches have issues related to generalization, usability, or model interpretability, especially due to
the complexity of target proteins' structure/function, and bias in system training datasets. Here, we propose a new method ""DRUIDom"" (DRUg Interacting Domain prediction) to identify bio-interactions between drug candidate compounds and targets by utilizing the domain modularity of proteins, to
overcome problems associated with current approaches. DRUIDom is composed of two methodological steps. First, ligands/compounds are statistically mapped to structural domains of their target proteins, with the aim of identifying their interactions. As such, other proteins containing the same mapped
domain or domain pair become new candidate targets for the corresponding compounds. Next, a million-scale dataset of small molecule compounds, including those mapped to domains in the previous step, are clustered based on their molecular similarities, and their domain associations are propagated to
other compounds within the same clusters. Experimentally verified bioactivity data points, obtained from public databases, are meticulously filtered to construct datasets of active/interacting and inactive/non-interacting drug/compound-target pairs (~2.9M data points), and used as training data for
calculating parameters of compound-domain mappings, which led to 27,032 high-confidence associations between 250 domains and 8,165 compounds, and a finalized output of ~5 million new compound-protein interactions. DRUIDom is experimentally validated by syntheses and bioactivity analyses of compounds
predicted to target LIM-kinase proteins, which play critical roles in the regulation of cell motility, cell cycle progression, and differentiation through actin filament dynamics. We showed that LIMK-inhibitor-2 and its derivatives significantly block the cancer cell migration through inhibition of
LIMK phosphorylation and the downstream protein cofilin. One of the derivative compounds (LIMKi-2d) was identified as a promising candidate due to its action on resistant Mahlavu liver cancer cells. The results demonstrated that DRUIDom can be exploited to identify drug candidate compounds for
intended targets and to predict new target proteins based on the defined compound-domain relationships. Datasets, results, and the source code of DRUIDom are fully-available at: https://github.com/cansyl/DRUIDom.",1
36316405,"Prediction of drug-target interactions through multi-task learning.. Identifying the binding between the target proteins and molecules is essential in drug discovery. The multi-task learning method has been introduced to facilitate knowledge sharing among tasks when the amount of information for each task is small. However, multi-task learning sometimes
worsens the overall performance or generates a trade-off between individual task's performance. In this study, we propose a general multi-task learning scheme that not only increases the average performance but also minimizes individual performance degradation, through group selection and knowledge
distillation. The groups are selected on the basis of chemical similarity between ligand sets of targets, and the similar targets in the same groups are trained together. During training, we apply knowledge distillation with teacher annealing. The multi-task learning models are guided by the
predictions of the single-task learning models. This method results in higher average performance than that from single-task learning and classic multi-task learning. Further analysis reveals that multi-task learning is particularly effective for low performance tasks, and knowledge distillation
helps the model avoid the degradation in individual task performance in multi-task learning.",0
37907030,"Drug-target affinity prediction method based on multi-scale information interaction and graph optimization.. Drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction as an emerging and effective method is widely applied to explore the strength of drug-target interactions in drug development research. By predicting these interactions, researchers can assess the potential efficacy and safety of candidate drugs at an
early stage, narrowing down the search space for therapeutic targets and accelerating the discovery and development of new drugs. However, existing DTA prediction models mainly use graphical representations of drug molecules, which lack information on interactions between individual substructures,
thus affecting prediction accuracy and model interpretability. Therefore, transformer and diffusion on drug graphs in DTA prediction (TDGraphDTA) are introduced to predict drug-target interactions using multi-scale information interaction and graph optimization. An interactive module is integrated
into feature extraction of drug and target features at different granularity levels. A diffusion model-based graph optimization module is proposed to improve the representation of molecular graph structures and enhance the interpretability of graph representations while obtaining optimal feature
representations. In addition, TDGraphDTA improves the accuracy and reliability of predictions by capturing relationships and contextual information between molecular substructures. The performance of the proposed TDGraphDTA in DTA prediction was verified on three publicly available benchmark
datasets (Davis, Metz, and KIBA). Compared with state-of-the-art baseline models, it achieved better results in terms of consistency index, R-squared, etc. Furthermore, compared with some existing methods, the proposed TDGraphDTA is demonstrated to have better structure capturing capabilities by

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a kind of complicated disease with an increasing incidence all over the world. A classic Chinese medicine formula, Zuojin pill (ZJP), was shown to exert therapeutic effects on HCC. However, its chemical and pharmacological profiles remain to be elucidated.
In the current study, network pharmacology approach was applied to characterize the action mechanism of ZJP on HCC. All compounds were obtained from the corresponding databases, and active compounds were selected according to their oral bioavailability and drug-likeness index. The potential proteins
of ZJP were obtained from the traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology (TCMSP) database and the traditional Chinese medicine integrated database (TCMID), whereas the potential genes of HCC were obtained from OncoDB.HCC and Liverome databases. The potential pathways related to genes were

33866349,"Deep drug-target binding affinity prediction with multiple attention blocks.. Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction has drawn increasing interest due to its substantial position in the drug discovery process. Many studies have introduced computational models to treat DTI prediction as a regression task, which directly predict the binding affinity of drug-target
pairs. However, existing studies (i) ignore the essential correlations between atoms when encoding drug compounds and (ii) model the interaction of drug-target pairs simply by concatenation. Based on those observations, in this study, we propose an end-to-end model with multiple attention blocks to

Our proposed model offers the abilities to (i) encode the correlations between atoms by a relation-aware self-attention block and (ii) model the interaction of drug representations and target representations by the multi-head attention block.
Experimental results of DTI prediction on two benchmark datasets show our approach outperforms existing methods, which are benefit from the correlation information encoded by the relation-aware self-attention block and the interaction information extracted by the multi-head attention block.
Moreover, we conduct the experiments on the effects of max relative position length and find out the best max relative position length value $k \in \{3, 5\}$. Furthermore, we apply our model to predict the binding affinity of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related genome sequences and $3137$

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common difficult disease with a high disability rate. Siegesbeckia orientalis L. (SO), a Chinese medicinal herb that is commonly used for treating RA in clinical practice. While, the anti-RA effect and the mechanisms of action of SO, as well as its active
compound(s) have not been elucidated clearly. We aim to explore the molecular mechanism of SO against RA by using network pharmacology analysis, as well as the in vitro and in vivo experimental validations, and to explore the potential bioactive compound(s) in SO. Network pharmacology is an advanced
technology that provides us an efficient way to study the therapeutic actions of herbs with the underlying mechanisms of action delineated. Here, we used this approach to explore the anti-RA effects of SO, and then the molecular biological approaches were used to verify the prediction. We first
established a drug-ingredient-target-disease network and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of SO-related RA targets, followed by the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. Further, we used lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated
RAW264.7 macrophages and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA)-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) models, as well as adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat model to validate the anti-RA effects of SO. The chemical profile of SO was also determined by using the UHPLC-TOF-MS/MS
analysis. Network pharmacology analysis highlighted inflammatory- and angiogenesis-related signaling pathways as promising pathways that mediate the anti-RA effects of SO. Further, in both in vivo and in vitro models, we found that the anti-RA effect of SO is at least partially due to the inhibition
of toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. Molecular docking analysis revealed that luteolin, an active compound in SO, shows the highest degree of connections in compound-target network; moreover, it has a direct binding to the TLR4/MD-2 complex, which is confirmed in cell models. Besides, more than
forty compounds including luteolin, darutoside and kaempferol corresponding to their individual peaks were identified tentatively via matching with the empirical molecular formulae and their mass fragments. We found that SO and its active compound luteolin exhibit anti-RA activities and potently
inhibit TLR4 signaling both in vitro and in vivo.

that GS and GC may exhibit synergistic or antagonistic effects in different combination designs. Here, we modeled the effects of GS/GC combination with a target interaction network and clarified the associations between the network topologies involving the drug targets and the drug combination
effects. Moreover, the ""edge-betweenness"" values, which is defined as the frequency with which edges are placed on the shortest paths between all pairs of modules in network, were calculated, and the ADRB1-PIK3CG interaction exhibited the greatest edge-betweenness value, suggesting its crucial role
in connecting the other edges in the network. Because ADRB1 and PIK3CG were putative targets of GS and GC, respectively, and both had functional interactions with AVPR2 approved as known therapeutic target for ascites, we proposed that the ADRB1-PIK3CG-AVPR2 signal axis might be involved in the
effects of the GS-GC combination on ascites. This proposal was further experimentally validated in a H22 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ascites model. Collectively, this systems-level investigation integrated drug target prediction and network analysis to reveal the combination principles of the

Human 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD-1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the generation of active cortisol from cortisone, thus regulating the availability of glucocorticoids for the steroid receptor. The involvement of this process in insulin insensitivity has established the
catalyst as therapeutic target in type-2 diabetes management. Herein, potent antagonists of 11β-HSD-1 were predicted from bioactive compounds identified from n-butanol fraction of <i>B. welwitschi</i> leaf using chromatography method (HPLC). Molecular docking, MM/GBSA evaluation, autoQSAR modeling,
e-pharmacophore modeling, and molecular dynamics simulation of the bioactive compounds were carried out against 11β-HSD-1 employing Schrodinger suite (2017-1). Seven out of the ten bioactive compounds from the fraction showed a higher degree of binding affinity against 11β-HSD-1 compared with the
co-crystalized ligand. The post-docking analysis revealed strong interaction due to the hydrogen bond formation between the molecules and amino acid present at the catalytic site of 11β-HSD-1. Rutin showed the highest binding affinity (-13.980 kcal/mol) among the hits comparable to the
co-crystalized ligand (-7.576 kcal/mol). The binding free energy (ΔG<sup>bind</sup>) evaluation validates the inhibitory potential of the docked complexes, which exclusively confirmed cyaniding-3-o-glucoside (-62.022 kcal/mol) with the highest binding energy followed by rutin (-59.629 kcal/mol). The
molecular dynamics simulations predicted the stability of rutin and quercetin-3-o-glycoside complex with 11β-HSD-1 through 100 ns with minimum fluctuation and more H-bond observed between the two top scored 11β-HSD-1-compound complexes compared to the 11β-HSD-1-co-crystalized ligand complex. The
pharmacokinetic profile revealed that the hit compounds are promising drug candidates except for rutin which violated more than one Lipinski's rule of five. This study revealed that bioactive compounds identified from <i>B. welwitschi</i> leaves demonstrated good inhibitory potential against

36291859,"Identification of EGFR-Related LINC00460/mir-338-3p/MCM4 Regulatory Axis as Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarker of Lung Adenocarcinoma Based on Comprehensive Bioinformatics Analysis and Experimental Validation.. <b>Background:</b> Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most aggressive and lethal tumor types and requires effective diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Though the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an important target for LUAD therapy, acquired resistance is still inevitable.
In recent years, the regulation of the EGFR by competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) has been extensively studied and significant progress has been made. Therefore, we aim to find new targets for the diagnosis and treatment of LUAD by analyzing the EGFR-related ceRNA network in LUAD and expect to
address the problem of EGFR resistance. <b>Methods:</b> We identified differentially expressed lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs closely associated with the EGFR by analyzing transcriptome data from LUAD samples. Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis strongly suggests that the LINC00460-mir-338-3p-MCM4
ceRNA network plays an important role in the diagnosis and prognosis of LUAD. The effects of different patterns of the LINC00460/MCM4 axis on the overall survival of patients with LUAD were analyzed by a polygene regulation model. We also verified the expression of these genes in LUAD cell lines and
tumor tissues by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The functional enrichment analysis and targeted drug prediction of the MCM4 gene were performed. <b>Results:</b> Survival analysis indicated that high expressions of LINC00460 and MCM4 predict a shorter survival period for patients. Univariate and
multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that higher expressions of LINC00460 and MCM4 were significantly associated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and TNM stage. A multi-gene regulation model analysis revealed that the LINC00460 (downregulation)-mir-338-3p
(upregulation)-MCM4 (downregulation) pattern significantly improved the overall survival of LUAD patients (<i>p</i> = 0.0093). RT-PCR and immunohistochemical experiments confirmed our analytical results. In addition, the functional enrichment analysis indicated that MCM4-related genes were mainly
enriched in the cell cycle and cell division. A functional association network analysis showed that MCM4 was closely related to the EGFR. Finally, the possible targeted drugs of MCM4 were queried through the drug database platform, hoping to solve its drug resistance problem by targeting
EGFR-related genes. <b>Conclusions:</b> In summary, the LINC00460/MCM4 axis can be used as a potential new perspective for targeting EGFR genes in precision medicine and is expected to serve as a diagnostic, prognostic and drug target for LUAD.",1

1320 BZBS targets with high confidence were predicted. Disease enrichment results strongly suggested that BZBS formula has the potential to be used in the treatment of AD. GO and KEGG enrichment results provide a preliminary verification of this point. Among them, 113 functional targets of BZBS
belong to AD pathway. A PPI network containing 113 functional targets and 1051 edges for the treatment of AD was constructed. <i>In vitro</i> experiments showed that BZBS could significantly reduce the release of TNF-α and IL-6 and the expression of COX-2 and PSEN1 in Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>-induced BV-2
cells, which may be related to the regulation of ERK<sub>1/2</sub>/NF-κB signaling pathway. BZBS reduced the apoptosis rate of Aβ<sub>25-35</sub> induced SH-SY5Y cells, significantly increased mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced the expression of Caspase3 active fragment and PSEN1, and
increased the expression of IDE. This may be related to the regulation of GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway. BZBS formula has a potential use in the treatment of AD, which is achieved through regulation of ERK<sub>1/2</sub>, NF-κB signaling pathways, and GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway.
Furthermore, the network pharmacology technology is a feasible drug repurposing strategy to reposition new clinical use of approved TCM and explore the mechanism of action. The study lays a foundation for the subsequent in-depth study of BZBS in the treatment of AD and provides a basis for its
application in the clinical treatment of AD.",1

Phenylspirodrimanes (PSD) are the sesquiterpene quinone type meroterpenoids found in nature. PSDs are found to exhibit inhibitory activity against immunocomplex diseases, and tyrosine kinase receptors. Three of the different PSDs C1, C2, and C3 that have been reported to be isolated from
the sponge-associated fungus <i>Stachybotrys chartarum</i> MUT 3308 are selected for studying their possible inhibitory effect against type 2 diabetes mellitus. Mechanistically, blocking protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) helps to reduce the insulin resistance induction caused by the high
expression of PTP1B. The QSAR, ADME, toxicity (T) study was carried out to predict the pharmacokinetic properties and the biological activities of the PSDs. PASS prediction web tool was used to find and select the target proteins 1NNY, and 2HNP. According to the molecular docking simulations, C1 and
C2 showed better binding affinity of -8.5 kcal/mol, and -8.1 kcal/mol respectively against 1NNY compared to the control ligand. RMSD, RMSF, R<sub>g</sub>, and SASA analysis revealed that both C1, and C2 showed better stability, minor conformational changes, and minor fluctuation upon binding to
PTP1B. Protein contact analysis was carried out to validate the residues that are in contact with the ligands according to molecular docking studies. Overall, C1, and C2 could be proposed as novel natural hits to be developed and small modifications of these PSDs could result in inducing the binding
affinity significantly, although experimental validation is required for further evaluation of the work.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",0
35958296,"In Silico Prediction of the Bioactive Profile and Metabolites of <i>Satureja nepeta</i> in Diseases Related to the Excessive Production of Interleukin-6.. Inflammatory bowel diseases are caused by an abnormal reaction of the immune system, which becomes hyperactive because the mechanisms responsible for regulating it get out of control. For an effective immune response, many proinflammatory cytokines are secreted, particularly interleukin-6
(IL-6) keystone cytokine inflammation. Many synthetic and natural compounds targeting IL-6 have been studied. The genus <i>Satureja</i> of the Lamiaceae family is generally known for its many virtues, in particular anti-inflammatory properties. However, the mechanism of action is unclear. This study
aims to predict the impact of characterized bioactive molecules of Moroccan <i>Satureja nepeta</i> in the potential control of inflammatory response mediated by IL-6 cytokine. A list of 9 previously characterized natural compounds of <i>S. nepeta</i> was compiled, and a list of 6 potential protein
targets involved in intestinal inflammation was made. The 2 lists of natural compound-target proteins were analyzed by the STITCH software (http://stitch.embl.de/) to develop protein-compound and protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs). An ontological enrichment (GO) analysis was performed by
the Clue GO plugin to evaluate the PPIN generated by STITCH; finally, the molecular docking to predict the mode underlying the anti-inflammatory effects. STITCH results revealed direct and indirect interactions of <i>S. nepeta</i> chemical compounds with a key protein target IL-6. The array results
by ClueGO showed that most compounds involved in the regulation of several biological processes related to IL-6 such as inflammation apoptosis, cell differentiation, and metabolic regulation. The targets directly related to IL-6 have been used for molecular docking. Quercetin, catechin, and gallic
acid have a strong affinity with the IL-6 receptor (respectively -7.1; -6.1; -5.3). This study strongly suggests that the bioactive compounds of <i>S. nepeta</i> could constitute a new therapeutic alternative in the treatment of diseases related to IL-6. However, to validate the results obtained in

Long-term exposure to ultraviolet light induces photoaging and may eventually increase the risk of skin carcinogenesis. Rare minor ginsenosides isolating from traditional medicine Panax (ginseng) have shown biomedical efficacy as antioxidation and antiphotodamage agents. However, due to
the difficulty of component extraction and wide variety of ginsenoside, the identification of active antiphotoaging ginsenoside remains a huge challenge. In this study, we proposed a novel <i>in silico</i> approach to identify potential compound against photoaging from 82 ginsenosides. Specifically,
we calculated the shortest distance between unknown and known antiphotoaging ginsenoside set in the chemical space and applied chemical structure similarity assessment, drug-likeness screening, and ADMET evaluation for the candidates. We highlighted three rare minor ginsenosides (C-Mc, Mx, and F2)
that possess high potential as antiphotoaging agents. Among them, C-Mc deriving from American ginseng (<i>Panax quinquefolius</i> L.) was validated by wet-lab experimental assays and showed significant antioxidant and cytoprotective activity against UVB-induced photodamage in human dermal
fibroblasts. Furthermore, system pharmacology analysis was conducted to explore the therapeutic targets and molecular mechanisms through integrating global drug-target network, high quality photoaging-related gene profile from multiomics data, and skin tissue-specific expression protein network. In
combination with <i>in vitro</i> assays, we found that C-Mc suppressed MMP production through regulating the MAPK/AP-1/NF-<i>κ</i>B pathway and expedited collagen synthesis via the TGF-<i>β</i>/Smad pathway, as well as enhanced the expression of Nrf2/ARE to hold a balance of endogenous oxidation.

In the biomedical field, the efficacy of most drugs is demonstrated by their interactions with targets, meanwhile, accurate prediction of the strength of drug-target binding is extremely important for drug development efforts. Traditional bioassay-based drug-target binding affinity (DTA)
prediction methods cannot meet the needs of drug R&D in the era of big data. Recent years we have witnessed significant success on deep learning-based models for drug-target binding affinity prediction task. However, these models only considered a single modality of drug and target information, and
some valuable information was not fully utilized. In fact, the information of different modalities of drug and target can complement each other, and more valuable information can be obtained by fusing the information of different modalities. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal information
fusion model for DTA prediction that is called FMDTA, which fully considers drug/target information in both string and graph modalities and balances the feature representations of different modalities by a contrastive learning approach. In addition, we exploited the alignment information of drug
atoms and target residues to capture the positional information of string patterns, which can extract more useful feature information in SMILES and target sequences. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that FMDTA outperforms the state-of-the-art model, demonstrating the feasibility

total of 624 natural ACE2 orthologous 32-amino acid long peptides were identified through a similarity search. Molecular docking was used to virtually screen and rank the peptides based on binding affinity metrics, benchmarked against human ACE2 peptide docked to the RBD. Molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations were done for the human reference and the <i>Nipponia nippon</i> peptide as it exhibited the highest binding affinity (Gibbs free energy; -14 kcal/mol) predicted from the docking results. The MD simulation confirmed the stability of the assessed peptide in the complex (-12.3 kcal/mol).
The top three docked-peptides (from <i>Chitinophaga sancti</i>, <i>Nipponia nippon</i>, and <i>Mus musculus</i>) and the human reference were experimentally validated by use of surface plasmon resonance technology. The human reference exhibited the weakest binding affinity (Kd of 318-441 pM) among
the peptides tested, in agreement with the docking prediction, while the peptide from <i>Nipponia nippon</i> was the best, with 267-538-fold higher affinity than the reference. The validated peptides merit further investigation. This work showcases that the approach herein can aid in the

Drug combinations are frequently used for the treatment of cancer patients in order to increase efficacy, decrease adverse side effects, or overcome drug resistance. Given the enormous number of drug combinations, it is cost- and time-consuming to screen all possible drug pairs

A multi-label classification model was presented to assign drugs into correct target groups. To make
full use of the known drug properties, five networks were constructed, each of which represented drug associations in one property. A powerful network embedding method, Mashup, was adopted to extract drug features from above-mentioned networks, based on which several machine learning algorithms,

In this study, the active components of DHI and its mechanism in the treatment of AMI were investigated. <b>Methods:</b>
The chemical components of DHI were detected by the ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-linear trap quadrupole-orbitrap-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS/MS), and the targets and pathways of DHI in the treatment of AMI were analyzed by systems pharmacology, which was verified

Unlike chemical drugs that have only one clear single target, the components of Chinese herbal formulae have multiple channels and targets. How to discover the pharmacological
targets of Chinese herbal formulae and their underlying molecular mechanism are still under investigation. DanQi pill (DQP), which is one of the widely prescribed traditional Chinese medicines, is applied as an example drug. In this study, we used the drug target prediction model (DrugCIPHER-CS) to
examine the underlying molecular mechanism of DQP, followed by experimental validation. A novel therapeutic effect pattern of DQP was identified. After determining the compounds in DQP, we used DrugCIPHER-CS to predict their potential targets. These potential targets were significantly enriched in
well-known cardiovascular disease-related pathways. For example, the biological processes of neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, calcium-signaling pathway, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis were involved. A new and significant pathway, arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, was also identified in this

36327172,"Predicting Drug-Target Interactions Over Heterogeneous Information Network.. Identifying Drug-Target Interactions (DTIs) is a critical step in studying pathogenesis and drug development. Due to the fact that conventional experimental methods usually suffer from high costs and low efficiency, various computational methods have been proposed to detect potential DTIs

In pharmaceutical sciences, a crucial step of the drug discovery process is the identification of drug-target interactions. However, only a small portion of the drug-target interactions have been experimentally validated, as the experimental validation is laborious and costly. To improve
the drug discovery efficiency, there is a great need for the development of accurate computational approaches that can predict potential drug-target interactions to direct the experimental verification. In this paper, we propose a novel drug-target interaction prediction algorithm, namely
neighborhood regularized logistic matrix factorization (NRLMF). Specifically, the proposed NRLMF method focuses on modeling the probability that a drug would interact with a target by logistic matrix factorization, where the properties of drugs and targets are represented by drug-specific and
target-specific latent vectors, respectively. Moreover, NRLMF assigns higher importance levels to positive observations (i.e., the observed interacting drug-target pairs) than negative observations (i.e., the unknown pairs). Because the positive observations are already experimentally verified, they
are usually more trustworthy. Furthermore, the local structure of the drug-target interaction data has also been exploited via neighborhood regularization to achieve better prediction accuracy. We conducted extensive experiments over four benchmark datasets, and NRLMF demonstrated its effectiveness
compared with five state-of-the-art approaches.",0

However, the key functional components are still poorly understood. This study aimed to construct a
mathematical model for screening of active ingredients in TCM prescriptions and apply it to THSWD on ischemic stroke. Botanical drugs and compounds in THSWD were acquired from multiple public TCM databases. All compounds were initially screened by ADMET properties. SEA, HitPick, and Swiss Target
Prediction were used for target prediction of the filtered compounds. Ischemic stroke pathological genes were acquired from the DisGeNet database. The compound-target-pathogenic gene (C-T-P) network of THSWD was constructed and then optimized using the multiobjective optimization (MOO) algorithm. We
calculated the cumulative target coverage score of each compound and screened the top compounds with 90% coverage. Finally, verification of the neuroprotective effect of these compounds was performed with the oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) model. The optimized C-T-P network

In MCAO/R rats, DZSM could significantly reduce the infarct volume. Putative target prediction and functional enrichment analysis based on network
pharmacological indicated that the key targets and the potential active compounds played important roles in DZSM's treatment to IS. The targets included four common genes (PTGS1, PTGS2, NFKB1 and NR1I2) and five key TFs (NFKB1, RELA, HIF1A, ESR1 and HDAC1), whilst 22 potential active compounds were
identified. Molecular docking indicated that good binding affinity have been seen between those compounds and NR1I2, NFKB1, and RELA. Multi-omics study revealed that DZSM could regulate glutamate by influencing citrate cycle and glutamate involved pathways, and have showed neuroprotection activity
and anti-inflammation activity by inhibiting NF-κB pathway. Neuroprotective effects of DZSM was validated by regulating of NF-κB signaling pathway and its downstream NO, TNF-α and IL-6 cytokines contributed to the activity of DZSM and its active compounds of scutellarin, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide,
ginsenoside Rb1, schizandrol A and 3, 5-diCQA, whilst the antithrombotic activity of DZSM and its active compounds of schisanhenol, apigenin and schisantherin B were screened out by anti-platelet aggregation experiment. DZSM could against IS via regulating its downstream NO, TNF-α and IL-6 cytokines

37437794,"Network pharmacology, molecular docking and experimental verification of the mechanism of huangqi-jixuecao herb pair in treatment of peritoneal fibrosis.. The Huangqi-Jixuecao herb pair (HQJXCHP) is a traditional herbal formula composed of two widely applied TCM prescriptions, Huangqi (Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge) and Jixuecao (Centella asiatica (L.) Urb.), used for hundreds of years to replenish qi and clear away heat. However,
the therapeutic effects of HQJXCHP against peritoneal fibrosis (PF) and potential targets are currently unclear. The main objective of this study was preliminary prediction and validation of the effects and molecular mechanisms of action of HQJXCHP against PF based on network pharmacology analysis
and experimental verification. The ingredients of HQJXCHP were analyzed via HPLC-Q-TOF/MS. Bioactive compounds of HQJXCHP used for network pharmacology analysis were obtained from the TCMSP database. HQJXCHP-related therapeutic targets in PF were obtained from the GeneCards, OMIM, Therapeutic
Targets and PharmGkb databases. Therapeutic target-related signaling pathways were predicted via GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. The targets of HQJXCHO were further validated in a PDS-induced PF mouse model in vivo and PMCs MMT model in vitro. A total of 23 bioactive compounds of HQJXCHP
related 188 target genes were retrieved. The HQJXCHP compound-target and PF-related target networks identified 131 common target genes. Subsequent protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis results disclosed Akt1, TP53, TNF, VEGFA and CASP3 as the top five key targets of HQJXCHP. Further
molecular docking data revealed strong affinity of the two key compounds of HQJXCHP, quercetin and kaempferol, for these key targets. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses further showed that PI3K/Akt, IL-17, TNF and TLR pathways contribute to the therapeutic effects of HQJXCHP on PF. An in vivo
PDS-induced PF mouse model and in vitro PMCs mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (MMT) model with or without HQJXCHP intervention were used to confirm the effects and mechanisms of action of HQJXCHP. Western blot and qRT-PCR results showed that HQ, JXC and HQJXCHP reduced PDS-induced inflammatory
cell aggregation and peritoneal thickening through suppressing the MMT process, among which HQJXCHP exerted the greatest therapeutic effect. Moreover, HQJXCHP inhibited activation of the PI3K/Akt, IL-17, TNF and TLR signaling pathways induced by PDS. This is the first study to employ network
pharmacology and molecular docking analyses to predict the targets of HQJXCHP with therapeutic effects on PDS-related PF. Data from in vivo and in vitro validation experiments collectively showed that HQJXCHP delays the PF process through inhibiting PI3K/Akt, IL-17, TNF and TLR signaling pathways.
Overall, our findings highlight the successful application of network pharmacology theory to provide a scientific basis for clinical utility of HQJXCHP against PF.",1
27139883,"Application of single-cell RNA sequencing in optimizing a combinatorial therapeutic strategy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma.. Intratumoral heterogeneity hampers the success of marker-based anticancer treatment because the targeted therapy may eliminate a specific subpopulation of tumor cells while leaving others unharmed. Accordingly, a rational strategy minimizing survival of the drug-resistant subpopulation is
essential to achieve long-term therapeutic efficacy. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we examine the intratumoral heterogeneity of a pair of primary renal cell carcinoma and its lung metastasis. Activation of drug target pathways demonstrates considerable variability between the primary
and metastatic sites, as well as among individual cancer cells within each site. Based on the prediction of multiple drug target pathway activation, we derive a combinatorial regimen co-targeting two mutually exclusive pathways for the metastatic cancer cells. This combinatorial strategy shows
significant increase in the treatment efficacy over monotherapy in the experimental validation using patient-derived xenograft platforms in vitro and in vivo. Our findings demonstrate the investigational application of single-cell RNA-seq in the design of an anticancer regimen. The approach may
overcome intratumoral heterogeneity which hampers the success of precision medicine.",1
34997041,"In silico construction of a multiepitope Zika virus vaccine using immunoinformatics tools.. Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus from the Flaviviridae family and Flavivirus genus. Neurological events have been associated with ZIKV-infected individuals, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, an autoimmune acute neuropathy that causes nerve demyelination and can induce paralysis. With the
increase of ZIKV infection incidence in 2015, malformation and microcephaly cases in newborns have grown considerably, which suggested congenital transmission. Therefore, the development of an effective vaccine against ZIKV became an urgent need. Live attenuated vaccines present some theoretical
risks for administration in pregnant women. Thus, we developed an in silico multiepitope vaccine against ZIKV. All structural and non-structural proteins were investigated using immunoinformatics tools designed for the prediction of CD4 + and CD8 + T cell epitopes. We selected 13 CD8 + and 12 CD4 +
T cell epitopes considering parameters such as binding affinity to HLA class I and II molecules, promiscuity based on the number of different HLA alleles that bind to the epitopes, and immunogenicity. ZIKV Envelope protein domain III (EDIII) was added to the vaccine construct, creating a hybrid
protein domain-multiepitope vaccine. Three high scoring continuous and two discontinuous B cell epitopes were found in EDIII. Aiming to increase the candidate vaccine antigenicity even further, we tested secondary and tertiary structures and physicochemical parameters of the vaccine conjugated to
four different protein adjuvants: flagellin, 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12, heparin-binding hemagglutinin, or RS09 synthetic peptide. The addition of the flagellin adjuvant increased the vaccine's predicted antigenicity. In silico predictions revealed that the protein is a probable antigen,
non-allergenic and predicted to be stable. The vaccine's average population coverage is estimated to be 87.86%, which indicates it can be administered worldwide. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) of individuals with previous ZIKV infection were tested for cytokine production in response to
the pool of CD4 and CD8 ZIKV peptide selected. CD4 + and CD8 + T cells showed significant production of IFN-γ upon stimulation and IL-2 production was also detected by CD8 + T cells, which indicated the potential of our peptides to be recognized by specific T cells and induce immune response. In
conclusion, we developed an in silico universal vaccine predicted to induce broad and high-coverage cellular and humoral immune responses against ZIKV, which can be a good candidate for posterior in vivo validation.",0
31479951,"Prediction of AChE-ligand affinity using the umbrella sampling simulation.. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is characterized as a key target for designing inhibitors to prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD). The binding free energy of a ligand to the AChE enzyme is a critical factor to screen the potential inhibitor in addition to pharmacokinetics and pharmacology
estimation. The biased sampling or umbrella sampling (US) method emerges as a reliable technique to estimate the AChE-inhibitor affinity. The affinity is computed as the difference between the largest and smallest values of the free energy change, obtained by using a potential of mean force (PMF)
analysis. The obtained affinities overestimate the experimental ones with a value of ∼4.10 kcal/mol. However, a very good correlation coefficient (R=0.94) between the computational and experimental values is observed. Consequently, the obtained precision is high since the mean error of the free
energy value is of δ=1.17 kcal/mol. The binding affinity of a new ligand can be consistently appraised via the US technique. Therefore, the absolute binding free energy of a ligand to the AChE protein can be obtained via the linear regression with the root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.98 kcal/mol.
The small value of RMSE implies that ligands revealing the similar binding affinities are able to be discriminated through the US simulations. In addition, the derivatives of Cordyceps were recently reported that they are able to inhibit the AChE enzyme, resulting in an improvement in learning and
cognitive ability for curing AD. The active metabolites of Cordyceps were thus evaluated as the potential inhibitors for the AChE enzyme, and the 5-Carboxy-2'-deoxyuridine compound can inhibit the activity of the AChE enzyme. These compounds are also passed the testing of Lipinski's rule of five,
toxicity, crossing blood-brain barrier (BBB) ability, and human intestinal absorption.",0

37720780,"Finding Lead Compounds for Dengue Antivirals from a Collection of Old Drugs through <i>In Silico</i> Target Prediction and Subsequent <i>In Vitro</i> Validation.. Dengue virus (DENV) infection is one of the most widely spread flavivirus infections. Despite the fatality it could cause, no antiviral treatment is currently available to treat the disease. Hence, this study aimed to repurpose old drugs as novel DENV NS3 inhibitors. Ligand-based (L-B) and
proteochemometric (PCM) prediction models were built using 62,354 bioactivity data to screen for potential NS3 inhibitors. Selected drugs were then subjected to the foci forming unit reduction assay (FFURA) and protease inhibition assay. Finally, molecular docking was performed to validate these
results. The <i>in silico</i> studies revealed that both models performed well in the internal and external validations. However, the L-B model showed better accuracy in the external validation in terms of its sensitivity (0.671). In the <i>in vitro</i> validation, all drugs (zileuton,
trimethadione, and linalool) were able to moderately inhibit the viral activities at the highest concentration tested. Zileuton showed comparable results with linalool when tested at 2 mM against the DENV NS3 protease, with a reduction of protease activity at 17.89 and 18.42%, respectively. Two new
compounds were also proposed through the combination of the selected drugs, which are ziltri (zilueton + trimethadione) and zilool (zileuton + linalool). The molecular docking study confirms the <i>in vitro</i> observations where all drugs and proposed compounds were able to achieve binding affinity
≥ -4.1 kcal/mol, with ziltri showing the highest affinity at -7.7 kcal/mol, surpassing the control, panduratin A. The occupation of both S1 and S2 subpockets of NS2B-NS3 may be essential and a reason for the lower binding energy shown by the proposed compounds compared to the screened drugs. Based
on the results, this study provided five potential new lead compounds (ziltri, zilool, zileuton, linalool, and trimethadione) for DENV that could be modified further.",1
35625468,"MSPEDTI: Prediction of Drug-Target Interactions via Molecular Structure with Protein Evolutionary Information.. The key to new drug discovery and development is first and foremost the search for molecular targets of drugs, thus advancing drug discovery and drug repositioning. However, traditional drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a costly, lengthy, high-risk, and low-success-rate system project.
Therefore, more and more pharmaceutical companies are trying to use computational technologies to screen existing drug molecules and mine new drugs, leading to accelerating new drug development. In the current study, we designed a deep learning computational model MSPEDTI based on <b>M</b>olecular

showed its competitive ability in ablation experiments and comparison with previous excellent methods. Additionally, 7 of 10 potential DTIs predicted by MSPEDTI were substantiated by the classical database. These excellent outcomes demonstrate the ability of MSPEDTI to provide reliable drug
candidate targets and strongly facilitate the development of drug repositioning and drug development.",0
34744006,"Design of a peptide-based vaccine from late stage specific immunogenic cross-reactive antigens of PE/PPE proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.. Since decades now, Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading cause of death globally. Innovative and extensive research strategies are necessary to lower TB incidence and achieve the End TB Strategy milestone. Epitope-based vaccine designing and development provides a promising solution with
high efficacy and effectiveness. Mining of less studied genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is crucial for recognizing potential antigenic peptide epitopes which can mount protective immune response in host. Many proteins from ESX associated Proline-Glutamate (PE)/ Proline-Proline-Glutamate
(PPE) family are virulence factors and alter host mediated immune response against the pathogen. In the present study, we have targeted 34 late stage expressing (being expressed at 90 days) PE/PPE proteins of Mtb for prediction and identification of promiscuous, immunogenic and cross-reactive
CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell specific epitopes. We found a total of 149 promiscuous and cross-reactive epitopes out of which 42 were antigenic as well. Further, we shortlisted top 10 Promiscuous, Cross-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell specific, Antigenic Peptide Epitopes (PCAPEs) which were characterized
to be non-allergenic and pro-inflammatory cytokine inducing in nature. These epitopes also showed strong binding affinity for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell restricted Major Histo-compatibility Complex (MHC) class I alleles. Additionally, these PCAPEs showed wide population coverage of 99.6% globally for
both MHC class I and class II alleles. Molecular docking studies were conducted to confirm the affinity of these shortlisted peptides for widely occurring MHC alleles. Additionally, we performed codon adaptation and in silico cloning of the recombinant vaccine construct incorporating EsxA (ESAT-6)
as an adjuvant and the 10 selected PCAPEs joined by linkers. The recombinant vaccine construct showed strong affinity for Toll-like receptor2 (TLR2) immune receptor in docking studies. In silico prediction based study using C-ImmSim server shows significant population of Th1 type immune cells with
memory cells lasting for months in response to our vaccine administration. Since, majority of TB vaccines under clinical trials are antigens expressed at early stages; a combinatorial approach inclusive of peptide epitopes derived from proteins being expressed at all stages could be a promising
strategy to design and develop effective TB vaccine. Synthesis and experimental validation of this multi-epitopic recombinant TB vaccine construct may result in an effective vaccine to confer protection against Mtb.",0

They are largely involved in the outbreaks of bacteremia, UTI, and endocarditis with a high transmissibility rate. The
recent emergence of VRE strain (i.e. vancomycin resistant enterococcus) turned it into high priority pathogen for which new drug research is of dire need. Therefore, in current study, pangenome and resistome analyses were performed for available antibiotic-resistant genomes (<i>n</i> = 216) of <i>E.
faecium</i>. It resulted in the prediction of around 5,059 genes as an accessory gene, 1,076 genes as core and 1,558 genes made up a unique genome fraction. Core genes common to all strains were further used for the identification of potent drug targets by applying subtractive genomics approach.
Moreover, the COG functional analysis showed that these genomes are highly enriched in metabolic pathways such as in translational, ribosomal, proteins, carbohydrates and nucleotide transport metabolism. Through subtractive genomics it was observed that 431 proteins were non-homologous to the human
proteome, 166 identified as essential for pathogen survival while 26 as potential and unique therapeutic targets. Finally, 3-dehydroquinate dehydrogenase was proposed as a potent drug target for further therapeutic candidate identification. Moreover, the molecular docking and dynamic simulation
technique were applied to performed a virtual screening of natural product libraries (i.e., TCM and Ayurvedic compounds) along with 3-amino-4,5-dihydroxy-cyclohex-1-enecarboxylate (DHS) as a standard compound to validate the study. Consequently, Argeloside I, Apigenin-7-<i>O</i>-gentiobioside (from

Genetic variants within nearly 1000 loci are known to contribute to modulation of blood lipid levels. However, the biological pathways underlying these associations are frequently unknown, limiting understanding of these findings and hindering downstream translational efforts such as drug
target discovery. To expand our understanding of the underlying biological pathways and mechanisms controlling blood lipid levels, we leverage a large multi-ancestry meta-analysis (N = 1,654,960) of blood lipids to prioritize putative causal genes for 2286 lipid associations using six gene
prediction approaches. Using phenome-wide association (PheWAS) scans, we identify relationships of genetically predicted lipid levels to other diseases and conditions. We confirm known pleiotropic associations with cardiovascular phenotypes and determine novel associations, notably with
cholelithiasis risk. We perform sex-stratified GWAS meta-analysis of lipid levels and show that 3-5% of autosomal lipid-associated loci demonstrate sex-biased effects. Finally, we report 21 novel lipid loci identified on the X chromosome. Many of the sex-biased autosomal and X chromosome lipid loci

36327885,"D3AI-Spike: A deep learning platform for predicting binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain with multiple amino acid mutations and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.. The number of SARS-CoV-2 spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) with multiple amino acid mutations is huge due to random mutations and combinatorial explosions, making it almost impossible to experimentally determine their binding affinities to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2).
Although computational prediction is an alternative way, there is still no online platform to predict the mutation effect of RBD on the hACE2 binding affinity until now. In this study, we developed a free online platform based on deep learning models, namely D3AI-Spike, for quickly predicting
binding affinity between spike RBD mutants and hACE2. The models based on CNN and CNN-RNN methods have the concordance index of around 0.8. Overall, the test results of the models are in agreement with the experimental data. To further evaluate the prediction power of D3AI-Spike, we predicted and
experimentally determined the binding affinity of a VUM (variants under monitoring) variant IHU (B.1.640.2), which has fourteen amino acid substitutions, including N501Y and E484K, and 9 deletions located in the spike protein. The predicted average affinity score for wild-type RBD and IHU to hACE2

Fufang Fanshiliu decoction (FFSLD) is a Chinese herbal medicine prescription that has been used in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), while the underlying mechanism remains unclear. To validate the efficacy and explore the potential mechanisms of FFSLD in treating T2DM via integrating a
network pharmacological approach and experimental evaluation. T2DM mice model induced by high-fat diet feeding combined with streptozotocin injection was selected to investigate the alleviation of FFSLD against T2DM, via detecting the levels of glucose, insulin, glucagon (GC), triglyceride (TG),
total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Network pharmacological analysis was used to predict the potential mechanisms, including the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness screening, active ingredients and potential targets
prediction, network analysis, and enrichment analysis. The candidate bioactive molecules of FFSLD, and targets information excavated through TCMSP, Uniprot, GeneCards, OMIM databases, were combined for comprehensive analysis by constructing ""drug-compound-target-disease"" and ""protein-protein
interaction"" networks. Enrichment analysis was performed via Gene Ontology (GO) and Koto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. HepG2 insulin-resistance (IR) cells model induced by high glucose was used to verify the potential mechanisms of FFSLD against T2DM which were predicted by the
network pharmacology. The animal study showed that FFSLD significantly decreased the blood glucose, and reversed the abnormal levels of insulin, GC, TG, TC, HDL-C, and LDL-C in T2DM mice. Network pharmacological analysis indicated that 106 active compounds of FFSLD might be correlated with 628
targets in treating T2DM, and the mechanism would probably be related to insulin resistance that harbored a high response value (P = 5.88844 E<sup>-33</sup>) though regulating Akt1, ESR1, oxidoreductase activity, and JAK/STAT signalings. Experimental validation showed that FFSLD reduced the ROS
level, up-regulated the expressions of p-AKT, Nrf-2, and ESR1, and down-regulated the expressions of JAK2, STAT3, and Keap-1 in the HepG2-IR cells model.

37762364,"A Robust Drug-Target Interaction Prediction Framework with Capsule Network and Transfer Learning.. Drug-target interactions (DTIs) are considered a crucial component of drug design and drug discovery. To date, many computational methods were developed for drug-target interactions, but they are insufficiently informative for accurately predicting DTIs due to the lack of experimentally
verified negative datasets, inaccurate molecular feature representation, and ineffective DTI classifiers. Therefore, we address the limitations of randomly selecting negative DTI data from unknown drug-target pairs by establishing two experimentally validated datasets and propose a capsule

38144565,"Exploration and validation of key genes associated with early lymph node metastasis in thyroid carcinoma using weighted gene co-expression network analysis and machine learning.. Thyroid carcinoma (THCA), the most common endocrine neoplasm, typically exhibits an indolent behavior. However, in some instances, lymph node metastasis (LNM) may occur in the early stages, with the underlying mechanisms not yet fully understood. LNM potential was defined as the tumor's
capability to metastasize to lymph nodes at an early stage, even when the tumor volume is small. We performed differential expression analysis using the 'Limma' R package and conducted enrichment analyses using the Metascape tool. Co-expression networks were established using the 'WGCNA' R package,
with the soft threshold power determined by the 'pickSoftThreshold' algorithm. For unsupervised clustering, we utilized the 'ConsensusCluster Plus' R package. To determine the topological features and degree centralities of each node (protein) within the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network, we
used the CytoNCA plugin integrated with the Cytoscape tool. Immune cell infiltration was assessed using the Immune Cell Abundance Identifier (ImmuCellAI) database. We applied the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) algorithms
individually, with the 'glmnet,' 'e1071,' and 'randomForest' R packages, respectively. Ridge regression was performed using the 'oncoPredict' algorithm, and all the predictions were based on data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database. To ascertain the protein expression
levels and subcellular localization of genes, we consulted the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. Molecular docking was carried out using the mcule 1-click Docking server online. Experimental validation of gene and protein expression levels was conducted through Real-Time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. Through WGCNA and PPI network analysis, we identified twelve hub genes as the most relevant to LNM potential from these two modules. These 12 hub genes displayed differential expression in THCA and exhibited significant correlations with the downregulation of
neutrophil infiltration, as well as the upregulation of dendritic cell and macrophage infiltration, along with activation of the EMT pathway in THCA. We propose a novel molecular classification approach and provide an online web-based nomogram for evaluating the LNM potential of THCA
(http://www.empowerstats.net/pmodel/?m=17617_LNM). Machine learning algorithms have identified ERBB3 as the most critical gene associated with LNM potential in THCA. ERBB3 exhibits high expression in patients with THCA who have experienced LNM or have advanced-stage disease. The differential
methylation levels partially explain this differential expression of ERBB3. ROC analysis has identified ERBB3 as a diagnostic marker for THCA (AUC=0.89), THCA with high LNM potential (AUC=0.75), and lymph nodes with tumor metastasis (AUC=0.86). We have presented a comprehensive review of endocrine
disruptor chemical (EDC) exposures, environmental toxins, and pharmacological agents that may potentially impact LNM potential. Molecular docking revealed a docking score of -10.1 kcal/mol for Lapatinib and ERBB3, indicating a strong binding affinity. In conclusion, our study, utilizing
bioinformatics analysis techniques, identified gene modules and hub genes influencing LNM potential in THCA patients. ERBB3 was identified as a key gene with therapeutic implications. We have also developed a novel molecular classification approach and a user-friendly web-based nomogram tool for
assessing LNM potential. These findings pave the way for investigations into the mechanisms underlying differences in LNM potential and provide guidance for personalized clinical treatment plans.",1
33868209,"An Inductive Logistic Matrix Factorization Model for Predicting Drug-Metabolite Association With Vicus Regularization.. Metabolites are closely related to human disease. The interaction between metabolites and drugs has drawn increasing attention in the field of pharmacomicrobiomics. However, only a small portion of the drug-metabolite interactions were experimentally observed due to the fact that
experimental validation is labor-intensive, costly, and time-consuming. Although a few computational approaches have been proposed to predict latent associations for various bipartite networks, such as miRNA-disease, drug-target interaction networks, and so on, to our best knowledge the associations
between drugs and metabolites have not been reported on a large scale. In this study, we propose a novel algorithm, namely inductive logistic matrix factorization (ILMF) to predict the latent associations between drugs and metabolites. Specifically, the proposed ILMF integrates drug-drug
interaction, metabolite-metabolite interaction, and drug-metabolite interaction into this framework, to model the probability that a drug would interact with a metabolite. Moreover, we exploit inductive matrix completion to guide the learning of projection matrices <i>U</i> and <i>V</i> that depend
on the low-dimensional feature representation matrices of drugs and metabolites: <i>F<sup>m</sup></i> and <i>F<sup>d</sup></i> . These two matrices can be obtained by fusing multiple data sources. Thus, <i>F<sup>d</sup></i> <i>U</i> and <i>F<sup>m</sup></i> <i>V</i> can be viewed as drug-specific
and metabolite-specific latent representations, different from classical LMF. Furthermore, we utilize the Vicus spectral matrix that reveals the refined local geometrical structure inherent in the original data to encode the relationships between drugs and metabolites. Extensive experiments are
conducted on a manually curated ""DrugMetaboliteAtlas"" dataset. The experimental results show that ILMF can achieve competitive performance compared with other state-of-the-art approaches, which demonstrates its effectiveness in predicting potential drug-metabolite associations.",0

The sudden outbreak of novel coronavirus has caused a global concern due to its infection rate and mortality. Despite extensive research, there are still no specific drugs or vaccines to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence, this study was designed to evaluate some plant-based active

protein. The top candidates were further employed for ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) analysis to investigate their drug profiles. Results suggest that none of the compounds render any undesirable consequences that could reduce their drug likeness properties. The analysis
of toxicity pattern revealed no significant tumorigenic, mutagenic, irritating, or reproductive effects by the compounds. However, withaferin was comparatively toxic among the top four candidates with considerable cytotoxicity and immunotoxicity. Most of the target class by top drug candidates
belonged to enzyme groups (e.g. oxidoreductases hydrolases, phosphatases). Moreover, results of drug similarity prediction revealed two approved structural analogs of Asiatic acid i.e. Hydrocortisone (DB00741) (previously used for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS) and Dinoprost-tromethamine (DB01160) from
DrugBank. In addition, two other biologically active compounds, Mupirocin (DB00410) and Simvastatin (DB00641) could be an option for the treatment of viral infections. The study may pave the way to develop effective medications and preventive measure against SARS-CoV-2. Due to the encouraging
results, we highly recommend further <i>in vivo</i> trials for the experimental validation of our findings.",0
36827526,"Machine Learning Guided Design of High-Affinity ACE2 Decoys for SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization.. A potential therapeutic strategy for neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 infection is engineering high-affinity soluble ACE2 decoy proteins to compete for binding to the viral spike (S) protein. Previously, a deep mutational scan of ACE2 was performed and has led to the identification of a triple
mutant variant, named sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v.2.4, that exhibits subnanomolar affinity to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S. Using a recently developed transfer learning algorithm, TLmutation, we sought to identify other ACE2 variants that may exhibit similar binding affinity with decreased
mutational load. Upon training a TLmutation model on the effects of single mutations, we identified multiple ACE2 double mutants that bind SARS-CoV-2 S with tighter affinity as compared to the wild type, most notably L79V;N90D that binds RBD similarly to ACE2<sub>2</sub>.v.2.4. The experimental
validation of the double mutants successfully demonstrates the use of machine learning approaches for engineering protein-protein interactions and identifying high-affinity ACE2 peptides for targeting SARS-CoV-2.",1
25058446,"Prediction of binding affinity and efficacy of thyroid hormone receptor ligands using QSAR and structure-based modeling methods.. The thyroid hormone receptor (THR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family that can be activated by endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC). Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models have been developed to facilitate the prioritization of THR-mediated EDC for
the experimental validation. The largest database of binding affinities available at the time of the study for ligand binding domain (LBD) of THRβ was assembled to generate both continuous and classification QSAR models with an external accuracy of R(2)=0.55 and CCR=0.76, respectively. In addition,
for the first time a QSAR model was developed to predict binding affinities of antagonists inhibiting the interaction of coactivators with the AF-2 domain of THRβ (R(2)=0.70). Furthermore, molecular docking studies were performed for a set of THRβ ligands (57 agonists and 15 antagonists of LBD, 210
antagonists of the AF-2 domain, supplemented by putative decoys/non-binders) using several THRβ structures retrieved from the Protein Data Bank. We found that two agonist-bound THRβ conformations could effectively discriminate their corresponding ligands from presumed non-binders. Moreover, one of
the agonist conformations could discriminate agonists from antagonists. Finally, we have conducted virtual screening of a chemical library compiled by the EPA as part of the Tox21 program to identify potential THRβ-mediated EDCs using both QSAR models and docking. We concluded that the library is
unlikely to have any EDC that would bind to the THRβ. Models developed in this study can be employed either to identify environmental chemicals interacting with the THR or, conversely, to eliminate the THR-mediated mechanism of action for chemicals of concern.",0
23757409,"Drug repurposing: mining protozoan proteomes for targets of known bioactive compounds.. To identify potential opportunities for drug repurposing by developing an automated approach to pre-screen the predicted proteomes of any organism against databases of known drug targets using only freely available resources. We employed a combination of Ruby scripts that leverage data
from the DrugBank and ChEMBL databases, MySQL, and BLAST to predict potential drugs and their targets from 13 published genomes. Results from a previous cell-based screen to identify inhibitors of Cryptosporidium parvum growth were used to validate our in-silico prediction method. In-vitro
validation of these results, using a cell-based C parvum growth assay, showed that the predicted inhibitors were significantly more likely than expected by chance to have confirmed activity, with 8.9-15.6% of predicted inhibitors confirmed depending on the drug target database used. This method was
then used to predict inhibitors for the following 13 disease-causing protozoan parasites, including: C parvum, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis, Leishmania braziliensis, Leishmania donovani, Leishmania major, Naegleria gruberi (in proxy of Naegleria fowleri), Plasmodium falciparum,
Plasmodium vivax, Toxoplasma gondii, Trichomonas vaginalis, Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi. Although proteome-wide screens for drug targets have disadvantages, in-silico methods can be developed that are fast, broad, inexpensive, and effective. In-vitro validation of our results for C
parvum indicate that the method presented here can be used to construct a library for more directed small molecule screening, or pipelined into structural modeling and docking programs to facilitate target-based drug development.",1
33352214,"A comprehensive screening of the whole proteome of hantavirus and designing a multi-epitope subunit vaccine for cross-protection against hantavirus: Structural vaccinology and immunoinformatics study.. Hantaviruses are an emerging zoonotic group of rodent-borne viruses that are having serious implications on global public health due to the increase in outbreaks. Since there is no permanent cure, there is increasing interest in developing a vaccine against the hantavirus. This research
aimed to design a robust cross-protective subunit vaccine using a novel immunoinformatics approach. After careful evaluation, the best predicted cytotoxic & helper T-cell and B-cell epitopes from nucleocapsid proteins, glycoproteins, RdRp proteins, and non-structural proteins were considered as
potential vaccine candidates. Among the four generated vaccine models with different adjuvant, the model with toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) agonist adjuvant was selected because of its high antigenicity, non-allergenicity, and structural quality. The selected model was 654 amino acids long and had a
molecular weight of 70.5 kDa, which characterizes the construct as a good antigenic vaccine candidate. The prediction of the conformational B-lymphocyte (CBL) epitope secured its ability to induce the humoral response. Thereafter, disulfide engineering improved vaccine stability. Afterwards, the
molecular docking confirmed a good binding affinity of -1292 kj/mol with considered immune receptor TLR-4 and the dynamics simulation showed high stability of the vaccine-receptor complex. Later, the in silico cloning confirmed the better expression of the constructed vaccine protein in E. coli K12.
Finally, in in silico immune simulation, significantly high levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), cytotoxic & helper T lymphocyte (CTL & HTL) populations, and numerous cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-2 (IL-2) etc. were found as coherence with actual immune
response and also showed faster antigen clearance for repeated exposures. Nonetheless, experimental validation can demonstrate the safety and cross-protective ability of the proposed vaccine to fight against hantavirus infection.",0
32241274,"SCNrank: spectral clustering for network-based ranking to reveal potential drug targets and its application in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common pancreatic malignancy. Due to its wide heterogeneity, PDAC acts aggressively and responds poorly to most chemotherapies, causing an urgent need for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Cell lines have been used as the
foundation for drug development and disease modeling. CRISPR-Cas9 plays a key role in every step-in drug discovery: from target identification and validation to preclinical cancer cell testing. Using cell-line models and CRISPR-Cas9 technology together make drug target prediction feasible. However,
there is still a large gap between predicted results and actionable targets in real tumors. Biological network models provide great modus to mimic genetic interactions in real biological systems, which can benefit gene perturbation studies and potential target identification for treating PDAC.
Nevertheless, building a network model that takes cell-line data and CRISPR-Cas9 data as input to accurately predict potential targets that will respond well on real tissue remains unsolved. We developed a novel algorithm 'Spectral Clustering for Network-based target Ranking' (SCNrank) that
systematically integrates three types of data: expression profiles from tumor tissue, normal tissue and cell-line PDAC; protein-protein interaction network (PPI); and CRISPR-Cas9 data to prioritize potential drug targets for PDAC. The whole algorithm can be classified into three steps: 1. using
STRING PPI network skeleton, SCNrank constructs tissue-specific networks with PDAC tumor and normal pancreas tissues from expression profiles; 2. With the same network skeleton, SCNrank constructs cell-line-specific networks using the cell-line PDAC expression profiles and CRISPR-Cas 9 data from
pancreatic cancer cell-lines; 3. SCNrank applies a novel spectral clustering approach to reduce data dimension and generate gene clusters that carry common features from both networks. Finally, SCNrank applies a scoring scheme called 'Target Influence score' (TI), which estimates a given target's
influence towards the cluster it belongs to, for scoring and ranking each drug target. We applied SCNrank to analyze 263 expression profiles, CRPSPR-Cas9 data from 22 different pancreatic cancer cell-lines and the STRING protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. With SCNrank, we successfully
constructed an integrated tissue PDAC network and an integrated cell-line PDAC network, both of which contain 4414 selected genes that are overexpressed in tumor tissue samples. After clustering, 4414 genes are distributed into 198 clusters, which include 367 targets of FDA approved drugs. These
drug targets are all scored and ranked by their TI scores, which we defined to measure their influence towards the network. We validated top-ranked targets in three aspects: Firstly, mapping them onto the existing clinical drug targets of PDAC to measure the concordance. Secondly, we performed
enrichment analysis to these drug targets and the clusters there are within, to reveal functional associations between clusters and PDAC; Thirdly, we performed survival analysis for the top-ranked targets to connect targets with clinical outcomes. Survival analysis reveals that overexpression of
three top-ranked genes, PGK1, HMMR and POLE2, significantly increases the risk of death in PDAC patients. SCNrank is an unbiased algorithm that systematically integrates multiple types of omics data to do potential drug target selection and ranking. SCNrank shows great capability in predicting drug
targets for PDAC. Pancreatic cancer-associated gene candidates predicted by our SCNrank approach have the potential to guide genetics-based anti-pancreatic drug discovery.",0

To investigate the mechanism of the effect of Astragalus membranaceus (A. membranaceus) on lung adenocarcinoma at the molecular level to elucidate the specific targets according to the network pharmacology approach. The active components of A. membranaceus and their potential targets were
collected from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database. Lung adenocarcinoma-associated genes were acquired based on GeneCards, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), PharmGKB, and Therapeutic Targets databases. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway-related genes were obtained
using Reactome portal. Networks of ""ingredient-target"" and ""ingredient-target-pathway-disease"" were constructed using the Cytoscape3.6.0 software. The relationships among targets were analyzed according protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Finally, molecular docking was applied to construct
the binding conformation between active ingredients and core targets. Cell counting kit 8 (CCK8) and Western blot assays were performed to determine the mechanism of the key ingredient of A. membranaceus. A total of 20 active components and their 329 targets, and 7,501 lung adenocarcinoma-related
genes and 130 PI3K/AKT signaling pathway-related genes were obtained. According to Venn diagram and PPI network analysis, 2 mainly active ingredients, including kaempferol and quercetin, and 6 core targets, including TP53, MAPK1, EGF, AKT1, ERBB2, and EGFR, were identified. The two important active
ingredients of A. membranaceus, kaempferol and quercetin, exert the therapeutic effect in lung adenocarcinoma partly by acting on the 6 core targets (TP53, MAPK1, EGF, AKT1, ERBB2, and EGFR) of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Expressions of potential targets in lung adenocarcinoma and normal samples
were analyzed by using UALCAN portal and found that ERBB2 was overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and upregulation of it correlated with clinicopathological characteristics. Finally, quercetin repressed viabilities of lung adenocarcinoma cells by targeting ERBB2 on PI3K/AKT signaling
confirmed by CCK8 and Western blot. Our finding unraveled that an active ingredient of A. membranaceus, quercetin, significantly inhibited the lung adenocarcinoma cells proliferation by repressing ERBB2 level and inactivating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.",1
37453362,"Drug approval prediction based on the discrepancy in gene perturbation effects between cells and humans.. Poor translation between in vitro and clinical studies due to the cells/humans discrepancy in drug target perturbation effects leads to safety failures in clinical trials, thus increasing drug development costs and reducing patients' life quality. Therefore, developing a predictive model
for drug approval considering the cells/humans discrepancy is needed to reduce drug attrition rates in clinical trials. Our machine learning framework predicts drug approval in clinical trials based on the cells/humans discrepancy in drug target perturbation effects. To evaluate the discrepancy to
predict drug approval (1404 approved and 1070 unapproved drugs), we analysed CRISPR-Cas9 knockout and loss-of-function mutation rate-based gene perturbation effects on cells and humans, respectively. To validate the risk of drug targets with the cells/humans discrepancy, we examined the targets of
failed and withdrawn drugs due to safety problems. Drug approvals in clinical trials were correlated with the cells/humans discrepancy in gene perturbation effects. Genes tolerant to perturbation effects on cells but intolerant to those on humans were associated with failed drug targets.
Furthermore, genes with the cells/humans discrepancy were related to drugs withdrawn due to severe side effects. Motivated by previous studies assessing drug safety through chemical properties, we improved drug approval prediction by integrating chemical information with the cells/humans
discrepancy. The cells/humans discrepancy in gene perturbation effects facilitates drug approval prediction and explains drug safety failures in clinical trials. S.K. received grants from the Korean National Research Foundation (2021R1A2B5B01001903 and 2020R1A6A1A03047902) and IITP (2019-0-01906,

This study aimed to reveal Danggui Buxue Decoction (DBD) candidate targets and mechanisms in the treatment of metastatic colon cancer (MCC), using network pharmacology-based analyses and experimental validation. Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database query and
text mining were used to screen active compounds in DBD, and the Swiss target prediction platform was applied to predict compound-related target proteins. Targets likely associated with MCC were determined using GeneCards and OMIM databases. Targets common to DBD and MCC were obtained from the Venn
platform; subsequently, Cytoscape was used to construct drug-compound-target-disease and protein-protein interaction networks. The hub gene was determined by R, while GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed on common targets to elucidate biological processes and signaling pathways involved in
DBD against MCC. Finally, the metastatic colon cancer mouse model was used to detect the levels of expression of protein Bax, Bcl2, Caspase3, and Cleaved caspase3 by Western blot. A total of 28 active compounds and 61 common targets were predicted. The main compounds were quercetin, hederagenin,
jaranol, methylnissolin, formononetin, calycosin, kaempferol, 3.9-di-O-methylnissolin, 24-propylcholesterol, and 7-O-methylisomucronulatol, present in Astragalus membranaceus (Huangqi, HQ).

34246738,"A new strategy for discovering effective substances and mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine based on standardized drug containing plasma and the absorbed ingredients composition, a case study of Xian-Ling-Gu-Bao capsules.. The overall therapeutic effect of traditional Chinese medicine formulae (TCMF) was achieved by the interactions of multiple components with multiple targets. However, current pharmacology research strategies have struggled to identify effective substance groups and encountered challenges
in elucidating the underlying mechanisms of TCMF. In this study, a comprehensive strategy was proposed and applied to elucidate the interactions of the multiple components that underlie the functions of the famous TCMF: Xian-Ling-Gu-Bao (XLGB) capsule on bone metabolism in vivo and to elucidate the
molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of XLGB on bone cells, especially on osteoblasts. The efficacy of XLGB in the protection against bones loss in ovariectomized (OVX) rats was confirmed by Micro-CT analysis. The anti-osteoporosis mechanism involved in the systemic regulatory actions of XLGB
was elucidated by transcriptome sequencing analysis on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells isolated from OVX rats. Moreover, the components absorbed in XLGB-treated plasma were characterized by mass spectrometry analysis, and subsequently, a standardized preparation process of drug-containing plasma
was established. The synergistic osteogenic effect of the multiple components in plasma was investigated by a combination and then knockout of components using pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells. In order to decipher the underlying mechanism of XLGB, the targets of the absorbed components on bone were
predicted by target prediction and network pharmacology analysis, then several interactions were validated by biochemical and cell-based assay. A total of 18 genes, including HDC, CXCL1/2, TNF, IL6 and Il1b, were newly found to be the major target genes regulated by XLGB. Interestingly, we found
that a combination of the three absorbed components, i.e. MSP, rather than their single form at the same concentration, stimulated the formation of calcified nodules in MC3T3-E1 cells, suggesting a synergistic effect of these components. Besides, target prediction and experimental validation
confirmed the binding affinity of corylin and icaritin for estrogen receptor α and β, the inhibitory activity of isobavachin and isobavachalcone on glycogen synthase kinase-3β, and the inhibitory activity of isobavachalcone on cathepsin K. The cell-based assay further confirmed the result of the
biochemical assay. A network that integrated absorbed components of XLGB-targets-perturbation genes-pathways against osteoporosis was established. Our current study provides a new systemic strategy for discovering active ingredient groups of TCM formulae and understanding their underlying
mechanisms.",1
37812388,"Optimization of drug-target affinity prediction methods through feature processing schemes.. Numerous high-accuracy drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction models, whose performance is heavily reliant on the drug and target feature information, are developed at the expense of complexity and interpretability. Feature extraction and optimization constitute a critical step that
significantly influences the enhancement of model performance, robustness, and interpretability. Many existing studies aim to comprehensively characterize drugs and targets by extracting features from multiple perspectives; however, this approach has drawbacks: (i) an abundance of redundant or noisy
features; and (ii) the feature sets often suffer from high dimensionality. In this study, to obtain a model with high accuracy and strong interpretability, we utilize various traditional and cutting-edge feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques to process self-associated features
and adjacent associated features. These optimized features are then fed into learning to rank to achieve efficient DTA prediction. Extensive experimental results on two commonly used datasets indicate that, among various feature optimization methods, the regression tree-based feature selection
method is most beneficial for constructing models with good performance and strong robustness. Then, by utilizing Shapley Additive Explanations values and the incremental feature selection approach, we obtain that the high-quality feature subset consists of the top 150D features and the top 20D
features have a breakthrough impact on the DTA prediction. In conclusion, our study thoroughly validates the importance of feature optimization in DTA prediction and serves as inspiration for constructing high-performance and high-interpretable models. https://github.com/RUXIAOQING964914140/FS_DTA.",0

Sinomenii Caulis (SC) is a well-konwn traditional Chinese medicine used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), dermatophytosis and paralysis. Patients with RA are usually secondary to osteoporosis, but the potential protective effect of SC on osteoporosis (OP) is seldom reported and
its possible action mechanism is little known. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the anti-osteoporosis effects of SC extract and alkaloids in prednisolone (Pre)-induced OP of zebrafish, and then to explore the potential mechanism of SC on system level by network pharmacology. Firstly,
zebrafish OP model was established to investigate the anti-osteoporosis effect of SC. Secondly, the targets of SC and OP from multiple databases were collected, and Compound-Target-Pathway network based on protein-protein interaction (PPI) was constructed. Moreover, gene enrichment and annotation
were performed via the DAVID server. Finally, the reliability of the network pharmacology prediction results in Pre-induced OP of zebrafish was verified by qRT-PCR. The results indicated that SC extract and alkaloids have remarkable ability to promote bone formation of cranial bones and reduce TRAP
contents in Pre-induced OP of zebrafish. 32 OP-related ingredients in SC and 77 OP-related targets were screened from multiple databases, and 15 OP-related pathways were enriched by the KEGG database. Further experimental validation indicated that SC extract and alkaloids could regulate the

Owing to a lack of response to the anti-PD1 therapy for most cancer patients, we develop a network approach to infer genes, pathways, and potential therapeutic combinations that are associated with tumor response to anti-PD1. Here, our prediction identifies genes and pathways known to be
associated with anti-PD1, and is further validated by 6 CRISPR gene sets associated with tumor resistance to cytotoxic T cells and targets of the 36 compounds that have been tested in clinical trials for combination treatments with anti-PD1. Integration of our top prediction and TCGA data identifies
hundreds of genes whose expression and genetic alterations that could affect response to anti-PD1 in each TCGA cancer type, and the comparison of these genes across cancer types reveals that the tumor immunoregulation associated with response to anti-PD1 would be tissue-specific. In addition, the
integration identifies the gene signature to calculate the MHC I association immunoscore (MIAS) that shows a good correlation with patient response to anti-PD1 for 411 melanoma samples complied from 6 cohorts. Furthermore, mapping drug target data to the top genes in our association prediction
identifies inhibitors that could potentially enhance tumor response to anti-PD1, such as inhibitors of the encoded proteins of CDK4, GSK3B, and PTK2.",0

35988839,"Network pharmacology-based prediction and verification of the active ingredients and potential targets of Huagan Decoction for reflux esophagitis.. Huagan Decoction (HGD), a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, has been widely used in the treatment of reflux esophagitis (RE). However, its effective compounds, potential targets and molecular mechanism remain unclear. To investigate effective compounds, potential targets
and molecular mechanism of HGD against RE by using network pharmacology combined with in vitro validation, with the aims of observing the action of HGD and exploring new therapeutic strategies for RE treatment. Effective compounds and potential targets of HGD, as well as related genes of RE, were
collected from public databases. Pharmacological clustering and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis were applied to find targets that involving in the anti-inflammatory module. The pathways were drawn using Cytoscape 3.8.0. Important ingredients, potential targets, and signaling pathways were
determined through the construction of protein-protein interaction (PPI), GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Subsequently, cell experiments were carried out. A total of 54 active ingredients and 240 RE-related gene targets of HGD were identified. The active compound-target
network was visualized and pharmacological clustering further sorted 53 proteins that involve in the regulation of inflammatory responses. GO analysis confirmed the classification was statistically significant. Analysis of compound-target network revealed that quercetin and geniposide may be key
ingredients for the anti-inflammatory effect of HGD against RE. The potential targets regulated by HGD are IL-6, IL-1β, PTGS2, AKT1, TNF-α, MAPK1, IL-8, IL-10, CCL2 and MAPK3. In vitro experiment showed that quercetin and geniposide could inhibit the inflammatory response of HET-1A cells through
p38MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway, which was consistent with the prediction by the network pharmacology approach. Geniposide and quercetin could be effective therapeutic ingredients for the HGD against RE. They play anti-inflammatory effects via down-regulating the pro-inflammatory cytokines and the
conduction of p38MAPK/NF-κB signal. This research provides a comprehensive study on the active components, potential targets, and molecular mechanisms of HGD against RE. Moreover, the study supplies a feasible approach to reveal the mechanisms of TCM formula.",1

Machine learning algorithms have been increasingly applied in drug development due to their efficiency and effectiveness. Machine learning-based drug repurposing can contribute to the identification of novel therapeutic applications for drugs with other indications. The current study used
a trained machine learning model to screen a vast chemical library for new JAK2 inhibitors, the biological activities of which were reported. Reference JAK2 inhibitors, comprising 1911 compounds, have experimentally determined IC<sub>50</sub> values. To generate the input to the machine learning
model, reference compounds were subjected to RDKit, a cheminformatic toolkit, to extract molecular descriptors. A Random Forest Regression model from the Scikit-learn machine learning library was applied to obtain a predictive regression model and to analyze each molecular descriptor's role in
determining IC<sub>50</sub> values in the reference data set. Then, IC<sub>50</sub> values of the library compounds, comprised of 1,576,903 compounds, were predicted using the generated regression model. Interestingly, some compounds that exhibit high IC<sub>50</sub> values from the prediction were
reported to possess JAK inhibition activity, which indicates the limitations of the prediction model. To confirm the JAK2 inhibition activity of predicted compounds, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation were carried out with the JAK inhibitor reference compound, tofacitinib. The
binding affinity of docked compounds in the active region of JAK2 was also analyzed by the gmxMMPBSA approach. Furthermore, experimental validation confirmed the results from the computational analysis. Results showed highly comparable outcomes concerning tofacitinib. Conclusively, the machine

37225408,"GraphscoreDTA: optimized graph neural network for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction.. Computational approaches for identifying the protein-ligand binding affinity can greatly facilitate drug discovery and development. At present, many deep learning-based models are proposed to predict the protein-ligand binding affinity and achieve significant performance improvement.
However, protein-ligand binding affinity prediction still has fundamental challenges. One challenge is that the mutual information between proteins and ligands is hard to capture. Another challenge is how to find and highlight the important atoms of the ligands and residues of the proteins. To solve
these limitations, we develop a novel graph neural network strategy with the Vina distance optimization terms (GraphscoreDTA) for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity, which takes the combination of graph neural network, bitransport information mechanism and physics-based distance terms into
account for the first time. Unlike other methods, GraphscoreDTA can not only effectively capture the protein-ligand pairs' mutual information but also highlight the important atoms of the ligands and residues of the proteins. The results show that GraphscoreDTA significantly outperforms existing
methods on multiple test sets. Furthermore, the tests of drug-target selectivity on the cyclin-dependent kinase and the homologous protein families demonstrate that GraphscoreDTA is a reliable tool for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. The resource codes are available at

33187537,"DLDTI: a learning-based framework for drug-target interaction identification using neural networks and network representation.. Drug repositioning, the strategy of unveiling novel targets of existing drugs could reduce costs and accelerate the pace of drug development. To elucidate the novel molecular mechanism of known drugs, considering the long time and high cost of experimental determination, the efficient and
feasible computational methods to predict the potential associations between drugs and targets are of great aid. A novel calculation model for drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction based on network representation learning and convolutional neural networks, called DLDTI, was generated. The
proposed approach simultaneously fused the topology of complex networks and diverse information from heterogeneous data sources, and coped with the noisy, incomplete, and high-dimensional nature of large-scale biological data by learning the low-dimensional and rich depth features of drugs and
proteins. The low-dimensional feature vectors were used to train DLDTI to obtain the optimal mapping space and to infer new DTIs by ranking candidates according to their proximity to the optimal mapping space. More specifically, based on the results from the DLDTI, we experimentally validated the
predicted targets of tetramethylpyrazine (TMPZ) on atherosclerosis progression in vivo. The experimental results showed that the DLDTI model achieved promising performance under fivefold cross-validations with AUC values of 0.9172, which was higher than the methods using different classifiers or
different feature combination methods mentioned in this paper. For the validation study of TMPZ on atherosclerosis, a total of 288 targets were identified and 190 of them were involved in platelet activation. The pathway analysis indicated signaling pathways, namely PI3K/Akt, cAMP and calcium
pathways might be the potential targets. Effects and molecular mechanism of TMPZ on atherosclerosis were experimentally confirmed in animal models. DLDTI model can serve as a useful tool to provide promising DTI candidates for experimental validation. Based on the predicted results of DLDTI model,
we found TMPZ could attenuate atherosclerosis by inhibiting signal transductions in platelets. The source code and datasets explored in this work are available at https://github.com/CUMTzackGit/DLDTI .",1

Hirudin III is an effective anti-coagulant; however, in 40% of treated patients, a high-titer of anti-Hirudin III IgG antibodies is observed. Development of antibody responses requires the activation of helper T lymphocyte (HTL), which is dependent on peptide epitopes binding to HLA class
II molecules. Based on computational prediction softwares, four new mutants of Hirudin III, T4K, S9G, V21G, and V21K, had been designed with the aim of reducing the binding affinity of these HTL epitopes. The constructed mutants have been purified and assayed for bioactivity. Finally in vitro and in
vivo cell-mediated responses were assessed and humoral immune assays were performed. All modified forms of Hirudin III were active, and showed significantly reduced human T-cell responses. All mutants indicated lower human IFN-γ level compared to native Hirudin, and V21K indicated lowest IFN-γ
level. Mice immunized with T4K and V21K showed a significant reduction in total antibody responses and mouse IFN-γ levels. Mice immunized with V21K after 3rd immunization had lower T-cell proliferation compared to native Hirudin and other mutants. Based on these results, V21K is proposed as the best
alternate Hirudin III candidate with lowest antigenicity. These findings validate our rational design strategy aimed at providing new active analogs of therapeutic proteins with reduced immunogenicity.",1

The oxidative stress hypothesis is challenging the dominant position of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the field of understanding the mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complicated and untreatable neurodegenerative disease. The goal of the present study was to uncover the oxidative stress
mechanisms causing AD, as well as the potential therapeutic targets and neuroprotective drugs against oxidative stress mechanisms. In this study, a systematic workflow combining pharmacological experiments and computational prediction were proposed. 222 drugs and natural products were collected
first and then tested on SH-SY5Y cells to obtain phenotypic screening data on neuroprotection. The preliminary screening data were integrated with drug-target interactions (DTIs) and multi-scale biomedical data, which were analyzed with statistical tests and gene set enrichment analysis. A
polypharmacology network was further constructed for investigation. 340 DTIs were matched in multiple databases, and 222 cell viability ratios were calculated for experimental compounds. We identified significant potential therapeutic targets based on oxidative stress mechanisms for AD, including
NR3C1, SHBG, ESR1, PGR, and AVPR1A, which might be closely related to neuroprotective effects and pathogenesis. 50% of the top 14 enriched pathways were found to correlate with AD, such as arachidonic acid metabolism and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. Several approved drugs in this
research were also found to exert neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress mechanisms, including beclometasone, methylprednisolone, and conivaptan. Our results indicated that NR3C1, SHBG, ESR1, PGR, and AVPR1A were promising therapeutic targets and several drugs may be repurposed from the

30742841,"Proteolytic cleavage of host proteins by the Group IV viral proteases of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and Zika virus.. The alphaviral nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) cysteine proteases (EC 3.4.22.-) are essential for the proteolytic processing of the nonstructural (ns) polyprotein and are validated drug targets. A common secondary role of these proteases is to antagonize the effects of interferon (IFN).
After delineating the cleavage site motif of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) nsP2 cysteine protease, we searched the human genome to identify host protein substrates. Here we identify a new host substrate of the VEEV nsP2 protease, human TRIM14, a component of the mitochondrial
antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) signalosome. Short stretches of homologous host-pathogen protein sequences (SSHHPS) are present in the nonstructural polyprotein and TRIM14. A 25-residue cyan-yellow fluorescent protein TRIM14 substrate was cleaved in vitro by the VEEV nsP2 protease and the
cleavage site was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry. A TRIM14 cleavage product also was found in VEEV-infected cell lysates. At least ten other Group IV (+)ssRNA viral proteases have been shown to cleave host proteins involved in generating the innate immune responses against viruses, suggesting
that the integration of these short host protein sequences into the viral protease cleavage sites may represent an embedded mechanism of IFN antagonism. This interference mechanism shows several parallels with those of CRISPR/Cas9 and RNAi/RISC, but with a protease recognizing a protein sequence
common to both the host and pathogen. The short host sequences embedded within the viral genome appear to be analogous to the short phage sequences found in a host's CRISPR spacer sequences. To test this algorithm, we applied it to another Group IV virus, Zika virus (ZIKV), and identified cleavage
sites within human SFRP1 (secreted frizzled related protein 1), a retinal G<sub>s</sub> alpha subunit, NT5M, and Forkhead box protein G1 (FOXG1) in vitro. Proteolytic cleavage of these proteins suggests a possible link between the protease and the virus-induced phenotype of ZIKV. The algorithm may
have value for selecting cell lines and animal models that recapitulate virus-induced phenotypes, predicting host-range and susceptibility, selecting oncolytic viruses, identifying biomarkers, and de-risking live virus vaccines. Inhibitors of the proteases that utilize this mechanism may both
inhibit viral replication and alleviate suppression of the innate immune responses.",1

Co-infection of <i>M. tuberculosis</i> with HIV and the emergence of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) constitute a serious global threat. However, no effective anti-TB drugs are available, with the
exception of first-line drugs such as isoniazid. The cell wall of <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, which is primarily responsible for the lack of effective anti-TB drugs and the escape of the bacteria from host immunity, is an important drug target. The core components of the cell wall of <i>M.

35379165,"Novel drug-target interactions via link prediction and network embedding.. As many interactions between the chemical and genomic space remain undiscovered, computational methods able to identify potential drug-target interactions (DTIs) are employed to accelerate drug discovery and reduce the required cost. Predicting new DTIs can leverage drug repurposing by
identifying new targets for approved drugs. However, developing an accurate computational framework that can efficiently incorporate chemical and genomic spaces remains extremely demanding. A key issue is that most DTI predictions suffer from the lack of experimentally validated negative
interactions or limited availability of target 3D structures. We report DT2Vec, a pipeline for DTI prediction based on graph embedding and gradient boosted tree classification. It maps drug-drug and protein-protein similarity networks to low-dimensional features and the DTI prediction is formulated
as binary classification based on a strategy of concatenating the drug and target embedding vectors as input features. DT2Vec was compared with three top-performing graph similarity-based algorithms on a standard benchmark dataset and achieved competitive results. In order to explore credible novel
DTIs, the model was applied to data from the ChEMBL repository that contain experimentally validated positive and negative interactions which yield a strong predictive model. Then, the developed model was applied to all possible unknown DTIs to predict new interactions. The applicability of DT2Vec

Developmental toxicity is defined as the occurrence of adverse effects on the developing organism as a result from exposure to a toxic agent. These alterations can have long-term acute effects. Current in vitro models present important limitations and the evaluation of toxicity is not
entirely objective. In silico methods have also shown limited success, in part due to complex and varied mechanisms of action that mediate developmental toxicity, which are sometimes poorly understood. In this article, we compiled a dataset of compounds with developmental toxicity categories and
annotated mechanisms of action for both toxic and non-toxic compounds (DVTOX). With it, we selected a panel of protein targets that might be part of putative Molecular Initiating Events (MIEs) of Adverse Outcome Pathways of developmental toxicity. The validity of this list of candidate MIEs was

The lack of success in target-based screening approaches to the discovery of antibacterial agents has led to reemergence of phenotypic screening as a successful approach of identifying bioactive, antibacterial compounds. A challenge though with this route is then to identify the molecular
target(s) and mechanism of action of the hits. This target identification, or deorphanization step, is often essential in further optimization and validation studies. Direct experimental identification of the molecular target of a screening hit is often complex, precisely because the properties and
specificity of the hit are not yet optimized against that target, and so many false positives are often obtained. An alternative is to use computational, predictive, approaches to hypothesize a mechanism of action, which can then be validated in a more directed and efficient manner. Specifically
here we present experimental validation of an in silico prediction from a large-scale screen performed against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis.

Antibiotic resistance is a major public health concern that has resulted in high healthcare costs, increased mortality, and the emergence of novel bacterial diseases. <i>Cardiobacterium valvarum</i>, an antibiotic-resistant bacterium, is one of the leading causes of heart disease.
Currently, there is no licensed vaccination against <i>C. valvarum</i>. In this research, an <i>in silico</i>-based vaccine was designed against <i>C. valvarum</i> using reverse vaccinology, bioinformatics, and immunoinformatics techniques. 4206 core proteins, 2027 nonredundant proteins, and 2179
redundant proteins were predicted. Among nonredundant proteins, 23 proteins were predicted in an extracellular membrane, 30 in the outer membrane, and 62 in the periplasmic membrane region. After applying several subtractive proteomics filters, two proteins, TonB-dependent siderophore receptor and
hypothetical protein, were chosen for epitope prediction. In the epitope selection phase, B and T-cellepitopes were analyzed and shortlisted for vaccine design. The vaccine model was designed by linking selected epitopes with GPGPG linkers to avoid flexibility. Furthermore, the vaccine model was
linked to cholera toxin B adjuvant to induce a proper immune response. The docking approach was utilized to analyze binding affinity to immune cell receptors. Molecular docking results predicted 12.75 kcal/mol for a Vaccine with MHC-I, 6.89 for a vaccine with MHC-II, and 19.51 vaccine with TLR-4.
The MMGBSA estimated -94, -78, and -76 kcal/mol for TLR-4 and vaccine, MHC-I and vaccine, and MHC-II and vaccine, while the MMPBSA analysis estimated -97, -61, and -72 kcal/mol for TLR-4 with the vaccine, MHC-I with vaccine, and MHC-II with a vaccine. Molecular dynamic simulation analysis revealed
that the designed vaccine construct has proper stability with immune cell receptors as it is essential for inducing an immune response. In conclusion, we observed that the model vaccine candidate has the potency to induce an immune response in the host. However, the study is designed purely on a

silico approach unveiled 21 putative molecular targets for mebendazole, including 12 proteins significantly upregulated at the gene level in glioblastoma as compared to normal brain tissue (fold change > 1.5; P < 0.0001). Validation experiments were performed on three major kinases involved in
cancer biology: ABL1, MAPK1/ERK2, and MAPK14/p38α. Mebendazole could inhibit the activity of these kinases in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, with a high potency against MAPK14 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 104 ± 46 nm). Its direct binding to MAPK14 was further validated in vitro, and inhibition of MAPK14
kinase activity was confirmed in live glioblastoma cells. Consistent with biophysical data, molecular modeling suggested that mebendazole was able to bind to the catalytic site of MAPK14. Finally, gene silencing demonstrated that MAPK14 is involved in glioblastoma tumor spheroid growth and response
to mebendazole treatment. This study thus highlighted the role of MAPK14 in the anticancer mechanism of action of mebendazole and provides further rationale for the pharmacological targeting of MAPK14 in brain tumors. It also opens new avenues for the development of novel MAPK14/p38α inhibitors to

35566330,"UnbiasedDTI: Mitigating Real-World Bias of Drug-Target Interaction Prediction by Using Deep Ensemble-Balanced Learning.. Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction through in vitro methods is expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, computational methods can save time and money while enhancing drug discovery efficiency. Most of the computational methods frame DTI prediction as a binary classification
task. One important challenge is that the number of negative interactions in all DTI-related datasets is far greater than the number of positive interactions, leading to the class imbalance problem. As a result, a classifier is trained biased towards the majority class (negative class), whereas the
minority class (interacting pairs) is of interest. This class imbalance problem is not widely taken into account in DTI prediction studies, and the few previous studies considering balancing in DTI do not focus on the imbalance issue itself. Additionally, they do not benefit from deep learning
models and experimental validation. In this study, we propose a computational framework along with experimental validations to predict drug-target interaction using an ensemble of deep learning models to address the class imbalance problem in the DTI domain. The objective of this paper is to
mitigate the bias in the prediction of DTI by focusing on the impact of balancing and maintaining other involved parameters at a constant value. Our analysis shows that the proposed model outperforms unbalanced models with the same architecture trained on the BindingDB both computationally and
experimentally. These findings demonstrate the significance of balancing, which reduces the bias towards the negative class and leads to better performance. It is important to note that leaning on computational results without experimentally validating them and by relying solely on AUROC and AUPRC

Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) is known to participate in a variety of disease-related cell signaling pathway and bisphosphonates (BPs) are served as FPPS inhibitors. However, the high polarity of BPs often induces a series of side effects, limiting their applications. In the
present study, novel non-BP FPPS inhibitors were discovered by in silico screening and experimental validation. From the structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) strategy combining molecular docking, pharmacophore and binding affinity prediction, 10 hits with novel scaffolds were filtered. The
inhibition activity of hits against FPPS was identified and 7 hits showed comparable or higher inhibition activity than Zoledronate. The hit VS-4 with higher lipophilicity (XlogP = 1.81) and binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 14.3 ± 2.63 μM) to FPPS was selected for further study on cancer cells with
different FPPS expression level. Experimental results revealed that VS-4 could better target the FPPS high-expressing colon LoVo and HCT116 cancer cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> of 51.772 ± 0.473 and 43.553 ± 1.027 μM, respectively, whereas the IC<sub>50</sub> value against FPPS low expressing
MDA-MB-231 cells was >100 μM. The mechanism of VS-4 against colon cancer cells was investigated by flow cytometry and the results indicated that VS-4 induced cell apoptosis by increasing the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Taken together, the SBVS strategy could be used to
discover promising non-BP FPPS inhibitors and the lead compound VS-4 might shed a light on designing more potent inhibitors as novel anticancer drugs.",1
36645186,"Exploring the mechanism of Cassiae semen in regulating lipid metabolism through network pharmacology and experimental validation.. Multiple studies have assessed the role of Cassiae semen (CS) in regulating lipid metabolism. However, the mechanism of action of CS on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has seen rare scrutiny. The objective of this study was to explore the regulatory mechanism of CS on lipid
metabolism in NAFLD. Components of CS ethanol extract (CSEE) were analyzed and identified using UPLC-Q-Orbirap HRMS. The candidate compounds of CS and its relative targets were extracted from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology, Swiss-Target-Prediction, and TargetNet web server.
The Therapeutic Target Database, Genecards, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, and DisGeNET were searched for NAFLD targets. Binding affinity between potential core components and key targets was established employing molecular docking simulations. After that, free fatty acid (FFA)-induced HepG2
cells were used to further validate part of the network pharmacology results. Six genes, including Caspase 3 (CASP3), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit α (PIK3CA), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and amyloid β (A4) precursor protein (APP) were identified as
key targets. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was found to associate closely with CS's effect on NAFLD. Per molecular docking findings, toralactone and quinizarin formed the most stable combinations with hub genes. About 0.1 (vs. FFA, P<0.01) and 0.2 (vs. FFA, P<0.05)
mg/ml CSEE decreased lipid accumulation in vitro by reversing the up-regulation of CASP3, EGFR, and APP and the down-regulation of PIK3CA. CSEE can significantly reduce intracellular lipid accumulation by modulating the MAPK signaling pathway to decrease CASP3 and EGFR expression.",1
33209251,"DEEPScreen: high performance drug-target interaction prediction with convolutional neural networks using 2-D structural compound representations.. The identification of physical interactions between drug candidate compounds and target biomolecules is an important process in drug discovery. Since conventional screening procedures are expensive and time consuming, computational approaches are employed to provide aid by automatically
predicting novel drug-target interactions (DTIs). In this study, we propose a large-scale DTI prediction system, DEEPScreen, for early stage drug discovery, using deep convolutional neural networks. One of the main advantages of DEEPScreen is employing readily available 2-D structural
representations of compounds at the input level instead of conventional descriptors that display limited performance. DEEPScreen learns complex features inherently from the 2-D representations, thus producing highly accurate predictions. The DEEPScreen system was trained for 704 target proteins
(using curated bioactivity data) and finalized with rigorous hyper-parameter optimization tests. We compared the performance of DEEPScreen against the state-of-the-art on multiple benchmark datasets to indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and verified selected novel predictions
through molecular docking analysis and literature-based validation. Finally, JAK proteins that were predicted by DEEPScreen as new targets of a well-known drug cladribine were experimentally demonstrated <i>in vitro</i> on cancer cells through STAT3 phosphorylation, which is the downstream effector
protein. The DEEPScreen system can be exploited in the fields of drug discovery and repurposing for <i>in silico</i> screening of the chemogenomic space, to provide novel DTIs which can be experimentally pursued.

Nowadays, acute intracerebral hemorrhage stroke (AICH) still causes higher mortality. Liangxue Tongyu Formula (LXTYF), originating from a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription, is widely used as auxiliary treatment for AICH. To dig into the multicomponent, multitarget, and
multipathway mechanism of LXTYF on treating AICH via network pharmacology and RNA-seq. Network pharmacology analysis was used by ingredient collection, target exploration and prediction, network construction, and Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG analysis, with the Cytoscape software and ClusterProfiler
package in R. The RNA-seq data of the AICH-rats were analyzed for differential expression and functional enrichments. Herb-Compound-Target-Pathway (H-C-T-P) network was shown to clarify the mechanism of LXTYF for AICH. 76 active ingredients (quercetin, Alanine, kaempferol, etc.) of LXTYF and 376
putative targets to alleviate AICH (PTGS2, PTGS1, ESR1, etc.) were successfully identified. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network indicated the important role of STAT3. The functional enrichment of GO and KEGG pathway showed that LXTYF is most likely to influence MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling
pathways for AICH treatment. From the RNA-seq of AICH-rats, 583 differential mRNAs were identified and 14 of them were consistent with the putative targets of LXTYF for AICH treatment. The KEGG pathway enrichment also implied that the MAPK signaling pathway was the most correlated one among all the
related signaling pathways. Many important targets with expression changes of LXTYF for AICH treatment and their related pathways are great markers of antioxidation, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptosis, and lowering blood pressure, which indicated that LXTYF may play mutiroles in the mechanisms for
AICH treatment. The LXTYF attenuates AICH partially by antioxidation, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptosis and lowers blood pressure roles through regulating the targets involved MAPK, calcium, apoptosis, and TNF signaling pathway, which provide notable clues for further experimental validation.",0

Chia seed peptides (CSP) can be a source of multifunctional biopeptides to treat non-communicable diseases. However, interactions and binding affinity involved in targeting specific receptors remains unexplored. In this study, molecular simulation techniques were used as virtual screening
of CSP to determine drug-like candidates using a multi-target-directed ligand approach. CSP fraction with the best bioactivities in vitro was sequenced. Then, a prediction model was built using physicochemical descriptors (hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, intestinal stability, antiangiogenic,
antihypertensive, and anti-inflammatory) to calculate potential scores and rank possible biopeptides. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) and ensemble molecular docking analysis were carried out using four human protein targets (ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme; VEGF, vascular
endothelial growth factor; GLUC, glucocorticoid and MINC, mineralocorticoid receptors). Five known-sequence peptides (NNVFYPF, FNIVFPG, SRPWPIDY, QLQRWFR, GSRFDWTR) and five de novo peptides (DFKF, DLRF, FKAF, FRSF, QFRF) had the lowest energy score and higher affinity for ACE and VEGF. The
therapeutic effects of these selected peptides can be related to the inhibition of the enzymes involved in angiogenesis and hypertension, due to formation of stable complexes with VEGF and ACE binding sites, respectively. The application of MDS is a good resource for identifying bioactive peptides

34652996,"Co-VAE: Drug-Target Binding Affinity Prediction by Co-Regularized Variational Autoencoders.. Identifying drug-target interactions has been a key step in drug discovery. Many computational methods have been proposed to directly determine whether drugs and targets can interact or not. Drug-target binding affinity is another type of data which could show the strength of the binding
interaction between a drug and a target. However, it is more challenging to predict drug-target binding affinity, and thus a very few studies follow this line. In our work, we propose a novel co-regularized variational autoencoders (Co-VAE) to predict drug-target binding affinity based on drug
structures and target sequences. The Co-VAE model consists of two VAEs for generating drug SMILES strings and target sequences, respectively, and a co-regularization part for generating the binding affinities. We theoretically prove that the Co-VAE model is to maximize the lower bound of the joint
likelihood of drug, protein and their affinity. The Co-VAE could predict drug-target affinity and generate new drugs which share similar targets with the input drugs. The experimental results on two datasets show that the Co-VAE could predict drug-target affinity better than existing affinity
prediction methods such as DeepDTA and DeepAffinity, and could generate more new valid drugs than existing methods such as GAN and VAE.",0

Abnormal accumulation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) can lead to metabolic diseases and cancers. Branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK) is a key negative regulator of BCAA catabolism, and targeting BCKDK provides a promising therapeutic approach for diseases caused
by BCAA accumulation. Here, we screened PPHN and POAB as novel putative allosteric inhibitors by integrating allosteric binding site prediction, large-scale ligand database virtual screening, and bioactivity evaluation assays. Both of them showed a high binding affinity to BCKDK, with K<sub>d</sub>

35471889,"AttentionDTA: Drug-Target Binding Affinity Prediction by Sequence-Based Deep Learning With Attention Mechanism.. The identification of drug-target relations (DTRs) is substantial in drug development. A large number of methods treat DTRs as drug-target interactions (DTIs), a binary classification problem. The main drawback of these methods are the lack of reliable negative samples and the absence of
many important aspects of DTR, including their dose dependence and quantitative affinities. With increasing number of publications of drug-protein binding affinity data recently, DTRs prediction can be viewed as a regression problem of drug-target affinities (DTAs) which reflects how tightly the
drug binds to the target and can present more detailed and specific information than DTIs. The growth of affinity data enables the use of deep learning architectures, which have been shown to be among the state-of-the-art methods in binding affinity prediction. Although relatively effective, due to
the black-box nature of deep learning, these models are less biologically interpretable. In this study, we proposed a deep learning-based model, named AttentionDTA, which uses attention mechanism to predict DTAs. Different from the models using 3D structures of drug-target complexes or graph
representation of drugs and proteins, the novelty of our work is to use attention mechanism to focus on key subsequences which are important in drug and protein sequences when predicting its affinity. We use two separate one-dimensional Convolution Neural Networks (1D-CNNs) to extract the semantic
information of drug's SMILES string and protein's amino acid sequence. Furthermore, a two-side multi-head attention mechanism is developed and embedded to our model to explore the relationship between drug features and protein features. We evaluate our model on three established DTA benchmark
datasets, Davis, Metz, and KIBA. AttentionDTA outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning methods under different evaluation metrics. The results show that the attention-based model can effectively extract protein features related to drug information and drug features related to protein
information to better predict drug target affinities. It is worth mentioning that we test our model on IC50 dataset, which provides the binding sites between drugs and proteins, to evaluate the ability of our model to locate binding sites. Finally, we visualize the attention weight to demonstrate
the biological significance of the model. The source code of AttentionDTA can be downloaded from https://github.com/zhaoqichang/AttentionDTA_TCBB.",0

Discovery of apicoplast as a drug target offers a new direction in the development of novel anti-malarial compounds, especially against the drug-resistant strains. Drugs such as azithromycin were reported to block the apicoplast development that leads to unusual phenotypes affecting the
parasite. This phenomenon suggests that identification of new apicoplast inhibitors will aid in the anti-malarial drug discovery. Therefore, in this study, we developed a computational model to predict apicoplast inhibitors by applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. We have used two
high-throughput chemical screening data (AID-504850, AID-504848) from PubChem BioAssay database and applied machine learning techniques. The performance of the models were assessed on various types of binary fingerprints. In this study, we developed a robust computational algorithm for the
prediction of apicoplast inhibition. We observed 73.7% sensitivity and 84% specificity along with 81.4% accuracy rate only on 41 PubChem fingerprints on 48 hrs dataset. Similarly, an accuracy rate of 75.8% was observed for 96 hrs dataset. Additionally, we observed that our model has ~70% positive
prediction rate on the independent dataset obtained from ChEMBL-NTD database. Furthermore, the fingerprint analysis suggested that compounds with at least one heteroatom containing hexagonal ring would most likely belong to the antimalarial category as compared to simple aliphatic compounds. We also
observed that aromatic compounds with oxygen and chlorine atoms were preferred in inhibitors class as compared to sulphur. Additionally, the compounds with average molecular weight >380Da and XlogP>4 were most likely to belong to the inhibitor category. This study highlighted the significance of
simple interpretable molecular properties along with some preferred substructure in designing the novel anti-malarial compounds. In addition to that, robustness and accuracy of models developed in the present work could be utilized to screen a large chemical library. Based on this study, we
developed freely available software at http://deepaklab. com/capi. This study would provide the best alternative for searching the novel apicoplast inhibitors against Plasmodium.",0
35871777,"Integrating Network Pharmacology, Molecular Docking, and Experimental Validation to Investigate the Mechanism of (-)-Guaiol Against Lung Adenocarcinoma.. BACKGROUND Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common type of lung cancer, which poses a serious threat to human life and health. -(-)Guaiol, an effective ingredient of many medicinal herbs, has been shown to have a high potential for tumor interference and suppression. However,
knowledge of pharmacological mechanisms is still lacking adequate identification or interpretation. MATERIAL AND METHODS The genes of LUAD patients collected from TCGA were analyzed using limma and WGCNA. In addition, targets of (-)-Guaiol treating LUAD were selected through a prediction network.
Venn analysis was then used to visualize the overlapping genes, which were further condensed using the PPI network. GO and KEGG analyses were performed sequentially, and the essential targets were evaluated and validated using molecular docking. In addition, cell-based verification, including the
CCK-8 assay, cell death assessment, apoptosis analysis, and western blot, was performed to determine the mechanism of action of (-)-Guaiol. RESULTS The genes included 959 differentially-expressed genes, 6075 highly-correlated genes, and 480 drug-target genes. Through multivariate analysis, 23 hub
genes were identified and functional enrichment analyses revealed that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was the most significant. Experiment results showed that -(-)Guaiol can inhibit LUAD cell growth and induce apoptosis. Additional evidence suggested that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway established
an inseparable role in the antitumor processes of -(-)Guaiol, which is consistent with network pharmacology results.

37663478,"Network Pharmacology-Based Approach to Investigate the Active Ingredients and Therapeutic Mechanisms of Jingu Tongxiao Pill against Osteoarthritis.. This study aimed to investigate the active ingredients and therapeutic mechanisms of Jingu Tongxiao Pill (JGTXP), a commonly used Chinese patent medicine, in treating osteoarthritis (OA) via network pharmacology analysis combined with experimental validation. First, we administered JGTXP
to rat plasma and identified the candidate active compounds. Next, target prediction, protein-protein interaction, compound-target network construction, gene ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses were conducted for JGTXP. Lastly, the network-derived
key targets and pathways were validated in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we identified 106 compounds in JGTXP and 24 absorbed compounds in the rat plasma. Network analysis revealed that JGTXP interferes with OA mainly via regulating the inflammatory response, collagen catabolic process, and osteoclast
differentiation, and the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in these processes. Experimentally, JGTXP exerted potential protective effects on articular cartilage and inhibited expression of inflammatory mediators and collagen catabolism-related proteins, including
interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 3 and MMP13, in a papain-induced OA rat model. Consistently, mRNA expression levels of these factors and nitric oxide release were suppressed by JGTXP in an LPS-induced RAW 264.7
inflammation model. The reporter gene assay showed that JGTXP could reduce the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Consecutive western blot analysis demonstrated that nuclear NF-κB p65, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression were inhibited while cytoplasmic
NF-κB p65 was upregulated by JGTXP. Using a combination of chemical profiling, network pharmacology analysis, and experimental validation, we preliminarily clarified the active ingredients of JGTXP intervention for OA and demonstrated that JGTXP ameliorates OA, at least partially, by regulating the
NF-κB signaling pathway.",1
26415726,"Computational probing protein-protein interactions targeting small molecules.. With the booming of interactome studies, a lot of interactions can be measured in a high throughput way and large scale datasets are available. It is becoming apparent that many different types of interactions can be potential drug targets. Compared with inhibition of a single protein,
inhibition of protein-protein interaction (PPI) is promising to improve the specificity with fewer adverse side-effects. Also it greatly broadens the drug target search space, which makes the drug target discovery difficult. Computational methods are highly desired to efficiently provide candidates
for further experiments and hold the promise to greatly accelerate the discovery of novel drug targets. Here, we propose a machine learning method to predict PPI targets in a genomic-wide scale. Specifically, we develop a computational method, named as PrePPItar, to Predict PPIs as drug targets by
uncovering the potential associations between drugs and PPIs. First, we survey the databases and manually construct a gold-standard positive dataset for drug and PPI interactions. This effort leads to a dataset with 227 associations among 63 PPIs and 113 FDA-approved drugs and allows us to build
models to learn the association rules from the data. Second, we characterize drugs by profiling in chemical structure, drug ATC-code annotation, and side-effect space and represent PPI similarity by a symmetrical S-kernel based on protein amino acid sequence. Then the drugs and PPIs are correlated
by Kronecker product kernel. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM), is trained to predict novel associations between drugs and PPIs. We validate our PrePPItar method on the well-established gold-standard dataset by cross-validation. We find that all chemical structure, drug ATC-code, and
side-effect information are predictive for PPI target. Moreover, we can increase the PPI target prediction coverage by integrating multiple data sources. Follow-up database search and pathway analysis indicate that our new predictions are worthy of future experimental validation. In conclusion,
PrePPItar can serve as a useful tool for PPI target discovery and provides a general heterogeneous data integrative framework. PrePPItar is available at http://doc.aporc.org/wiki/PrePPItar. ycwang@nwipb.cas.cn or ywang@amss.ac.cn Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0

It is a key interaction principle in biology and promising for the synthesis of high-affinity inhibitors of pathogens. We present a molecular model for the binding affinity of
synthetic multivalent ligands onto multivalent receptors consisting of n receptor units arranged on a regular polygon. Ligands consist of a geometrically matching rigid polygonal core to which monovalent ligand units are attached via flexible linker polymers, closely mimicking existing experimental
designs. The calculated binding affinities quantitatively agree with experimental studies for cholera toxin ( n = 5) and anthrax receptor ( n = 7) and allow to predict optimal core size and optimal linker length. Maximal binding affinity is achieved for a core that matches the receptor size and for
linkers that have an equilibrium end-to-end distance that is slightly longer than the geometric separation between ligand core and receptor sites. Linkers that are longer than optimal are greatly preferable compared to shorter linkers. The angular steric restriction between ligand unit and linker

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. <b>Objective:</b>
Combine network pharmacology with experimental validation to explore the potential molecular mechanisms underlying ELZC with a systematic viewpoint. <b>Methods:</b> The chemical components of ELZC were collected from the Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology database, and their possible
target proteins were predicted using the SwissTargetPrediction database. The putative ARHL-related target proteins were identified from the database: GeneCards and OMIM. We constructed the drug-target network as well as drug-disease specific protein-protein interaction networks and performed
clustering and topological property analyses. Functional annotation and signaling pathways were performed by gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis. Finally, <i>in vitro</i> experiments were also performed to validate ELZC's key target proteins and treatment
effects on ARHL. <b>Results:</b> In total, 63 chemical compounds from ELZC and 365 putative ARHL-related targets were identified, and 1860 ARHL-related targets were collected from the OMIM and GeneCards. A total of 145 shared targets of ELZC and ARHL were acquired by Venn diagram analysis.
Functional enrichment analysis suggested that ELZC might exert its pharmacological effects in multiple biological processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, inflammatory response, and synaptic connections, and the potential targets might be associated with AKT, ERK, and STAT3, as well as

34667533,"Structure-guided machine learning prediction of drug resistance mutations in Abelson 1 kinase.. Kinases play crucial roles in cellular signalling and biological processes with their dysregulation associated with diseases, including cancers. Kinase inhibitors, most notably those targeting ABeLson 1 (ABL1) kinase in chronic myeloid leukemia, have had a significant impact on cancer
survival, yet emergence of resistance mutations can reduce their effectiveness, leading to therapeutic failure. Limited effort, however, has been devoted to developing tools to accurately identify ABL1 resistance mutations, as well as providing insights into their molecular mechanisms. Here we
investigated the structural basis of ABL1 mutations modulating binding affinity of eight FDA-approved drugs. We found mutations impair affinity of type I and type II inhibitors differently and used this insight to developed a novel web-based diagnostic tool, SUSPECT-ABL, to pre-emptively predict
resistance profiles and binding free-energy changes (ΔΔ<i>G</i>) of all possible ABL1 mutations against inhibitors with different binding modes. Resistance mutations in ABL1 were successfully identified, achieving a Matthew's Correlation Coefficient of up to 0.73 and the resulting change in ligand
binding affinity with a Pearson's correlation of up to 0.77, with performances consistent across non-redundant blind tests. Through an <i>in silico</i> saturation mutagenesis, our tool has identified possibly emerging resistance mutations, which offers opportunities for <i>in vivo</i> experimental
validation. We believe SUSPECT-ABL will be an important tool not just for improving precision medicine efforts, but for facilitating the development of next-generation inhibitors that are less prone to resistance.

Camellia <i>nitidissima</i> Chi (CNC) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with anticancer property. However, its underlying mechanisms of anti-colon cancer (CC) remain unknown. Therefore, a systematic approach is proposed in the present study to elucidate the anticancer mechanisms of
CNC based on network pharmacology and experimental validation. Initially, the potential active ingredients of CNC were verified via the TCMSP database based on the oral bioavailability (OB) and drug-likeness (DL) terms. Hub targets of CNC were acquired from SwissTarget prediction and TCMSP
databases, and target genes related to CC were gathered from GeneCards and OMIM databases. Cytoscape was used to establish the compound-target networks. Next, the hub target genes collected from the CNC and CC were parsed via GO and KEGG analysis. Results of GO and KEGG analysis reveal that
quercetin and luteolin in CNC, VEGFA and AKT1 targets, and PI3K-Akt pathway were associated with the suppression of CC. Besides, the result of molecular docking unveils that VEGFA demonstrates the most powerful binding affinity among the binding outcomes. This finding was successfully validated

The identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is an essential step in the process of drug discovery. As experimental validation suffers from high cost and low success rate, various computational models have been exploited to infer potential DTIs. The performance of DTI prediction
depends heavily on the features extracted from drugs and target proteins. The existing predictors vary in input information and each has its own advantages. Therefore, combining the advantages of individual models and generating high-quality representations for drug-target pairs are effective ways
to improve the performance of DTI prediction. In this study, we exploit both biochemical characteristics of drugs via network integration and molecular sequences via word embeddings, then we develop an ensemble model, KenDTI, based on two types of methods, i.e., network-based and
classification-based. We assess the performance of KenDTI on two large-scale datasets, The experimental results show that KenDTI outperforms the state-of-the-art DTI predictors by a large margin. Moreover, KenDTI is robust against missing data in input networks and lack of prior knowledge. It is

30423097,"DeepDTA: deep drug-target binding affinity prediction.. The identification of novel drug-target (DT) interactions is a substantial part of the drug discovery process. Most of the computational methods that have been proposed to predict DT interactions have focused on binary classification, where the goal is to determine whether a DT pair
interacts or not. However, protein-ligand interactions assume a continuum of binding strength values, also called binding affinity and predicting this value still remains a challenge. The increase in the affinity data available in DT knowledge-bases allows the use of advanced learning techniques
such as deep learning architectures in the prediction of binding affinities. In this study, we propose a deep-learning based model that uses only sequence information of both targets and drugs to predict DT interaction binding affinities. The few studies that focus on DT binding affinity prediction
use either 3D structures of protein-ligand complexes or 2D features of compounds. One novel approach used in this work is the modeling of protein sequences and compound 1D representations with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results show that the proposed deep learning based model that
uses the 1D representations of targets and drugs is an effective approach for drug target binding affinity prediction. The model in which high-level representations of a drug and a target are constructed via CNNs achieved the best Concordance Index (CI) performance in one of our larger benchmark

The emergence of superbugs of multi-drug resistant (MDR/RR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>) strains at a faster rate is posing a serious threat to Tuberculosis (TB) control worldwide. <i>Mtb</i> enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA)
is a well-established target of the front-line anti-TB prodrug Isoniazid (INH), which requires activation by Catalase-peroxidase enzyme (KatG) in order to inhibit InhA enzyme, that is crucial for the biosynthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall. Currently, due to widespread resistance to this drug,
it is necessary to identify new clinical candidates that directly inhibit InhA enzyme and do not require activation by KatG, thereby circumventing most of the resistance mechanisms. In the present study, high-throughput virtual screening of ASINEX database was carried out to identify potential
direct inhibitors of <i>Mtb</i> InhA. Best twenty compounds with good binding energies ranging between -12.36 and -9.27 kcal/mol were selected as promising virtual screening hits. These molecules were subjected to ADME study followed by toxicity prediction. Finally, four top-ranked molecules which
are structurally diverse and possess best binding affinity than the co-crystalized ligand have been chosen for MD simulation studies followed by MM-GBSA analysis to validate and ensure the stability of hits in the active site of the enzyme. Based on the 100 ns MD simulation studies and binding free

In 2022, the ongoing multi-country outbreak of monkeypox virus-now occurring outside Africa, too is a global health concern. Monkeypox is a zoonotic virus, which causes disease mainly in animals, and then it is transferred to humans. Recently, in the monkeypox epidemic, a large number of
human cases emerged while the global health community worked to tackle the outbreak and save lives. Herein, a multi-epitope-based vaccine is designed against monkeypox virus using two surface-associated proteins: MPXVgp002 accession number > YP_010377003.1 and MPXVgp008 accession number >
YP_010377007.1 proteins. These proteins were utilized for B- and T-cell epitopes prediction. The epitopes were further screened, and the screen filtered KCKDNEYRSR, RSCNTTHNR, and RTRRETGAS with the antigenicity scores of 0.5279, 0.5604, and 0.7628, respectively. Overall, the epitopes can induce
immunity in 99.74% population of the world. Further, GPGPG linkers were used for joining the epitopes and EAAAK linker was used for adjuvant attachment. It has a three-dimensional structure modelled for retaining the structural stability. Three pairs of amino acid residues that were able to make
disulfide bonds were chosen: Gly1-Ser82, Cys7-Tyr10, and Phe51-Ile55. Molecular docking of vaccine was done with toll-like receptors, viz., 2, 3, 4, and 8 immune cell receptors. The docking results revealed that the vaccine as potential molecule due to its better binding affinity with toll-like
receptors 2, 3, 4 and 8. Top complex in docking in with each receptor was selected based on lowest energy scores- -888.7 kcal/mol (TLR-2), -976.3 kcal/mol (TLR-3), -801.9 kcal/mol (TLR-4), and -955.4 kcal/mol (TLR-4)-were subjected to simulation. The docked complexes were evaluated in 500 ns of MD

In recent years, the rapid development of network-based methods for the prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs) provides an opportunity for the emergence of a new type of virtual screening (VS), namely, network-based VS. Herein, we reported a novel network-based inference method

SCYX-7158) and AN11736, respectively. These benzoxaboroles will likely be key to the World Health Organization's target of disease control by 2030. Their mode of action was previously unknown. We have developed a high-coverage overexpression library and use it here to explore drug mode of action in
<i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> Initially, an inhibitor with a known target was used to select for drug resistance and to test massive parallel library screening and genome-wide mapping; this effectively identified the known target and validated the approach. Subsequently, the overexpression screening
approach was used to identify the target of the benzoxaboroles, Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor 3 (CPSF3, Tb927.4.1340). We validated the CPSF3 endonuclease as the target, using independent overexpression strains. Knockdown provided genetic validation of CPSF3 as essential, and GFP
tagging confirmed the expected nuclear localization. Molecular docking and CRISPR-Cas9-based editing demonstrated how acoziborole can specifically block the active site and mRNA processing by parasite, but not host CPSF3. Thus, our findings provide both genetic and chemical validation for CPSF3 as
an important drug target in trypanosomes and reveal inhibition of mRNA maturation as the mode of action of the trypanocidal benzoxaboroles.

37680152,"Comprehensive Review on Drug-target Interaction Prediction - Latest Developments and Overview.. Drug-target interactions (DTIs) are an important part of the drug development process. When the drug (a chemical molecule) binds to a target (proteins or nucleic acids), it modulates the biological behavior/function of the target, returning it to its normal state. Predicting DTIs plays a
vital role in the drug discovery (DD) process as it has the potential to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. However, DTI prediction poses significant challenges and expenses due to the time-consuming and costly nature of experimental assays. As a result, researchers have increased their efforts to

The present study has developed a new approach to examine apoptotic activity of a known PAH called benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), using protein-ligand and
protein-protein interaction through in silico approach, followed by in vitro validation. In silico study showed that the conformational changes and energies involved in the binding of B[a]P to CYP1B1 was crucial with its target proteins. The data showed that activated B[a]P had high affinity to bind
with aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) with binding energy of -601.97kcal/mol. Interestingly, B[a]P-CYP1B1 complex showed strong binding affinity for caspase-8, -9, -3 with binding energy of -625.5, -479.3 and -514.2kcal/mol respectively. Moreover, the docking of specific caspase inhibitors in the
complex showed weak interaction with low binding energy value as compared to B[a]P-CYP1B1 caspase complexes. To validate our in silico work, we showed B[a]P treated HaCaT cells triggered apoptosis with increase in caspase 8, caspase 9 and caspase 3/7 level. Further, in vitro work confirmed that
B[a]P induced apoptosis was significantly suppressed in Ac-DEVD-CMK pre-treated cells. In addition, knockdown of CYP1B1 suppressed B[a]P induced apoptosis in HaCaT cells confirming a pivotal role of CYP1B1 in B[a]P induced apoptosis. Interestingly, through in silico modeling, we screened

pro-inflammatory cytokines for protection and later release of anti-inflammatory cytokines for prevention of immunopathology in designing a vaccine for Covid-19. Therefore, the selected immunogenic OAPE were subjected to in silico tools (IL-6-Pred, IFNepitope and PIP-EL) for analyzing their
pro-inflammatory response. The OAPEs found to be pro-inflammatory in nature were further subjected to prediction servers (IL-4-Pred, IL-10-Pred, Pre-AIP) to characterize them as inducers of anti-inflammatory response as well. We finally filtered out 12 OAPE which had affinity for both CD4 and CD8 T
cells as well as were inducers of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. On confirmation of OAPE binding affinity for respective T cell specific MHC allele using docking studies (pepATTRACT, Hex8.0 and Discovery studio) they were found to be have more immunogenic potential than the 3
negative control peptides (NCPs) included in the study. Additionally, we constructed CTxB-adjuvanated multi-epitopic vaccine inclusive of the 12 OAPEs which was non-toxic, non-allergenic and capable of inducing both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. A successful in silico cloning and
docking of modeled subunit vaccine construct with toll like receptor-2 (TLR-2) confirmed the high efficacy of our multi-epitopic vaccine which can through a balanced interplay of cytokines help in creating a steady-state immune equilibrium. In silico immune simulation studies with the vaccine using

vindicate the protective effects of PUR on diabetic nephropathy in type 2 DN rat model. In silico, pharmacophore matching and enrichment analysis were adopted to predict the potential mechanism of PUR on DN. In vitro, we utilized high glucose stress to induce impairment in glomerular mesangial cells
(GMCs) as diabetic nephropathy cell model. Cell count kit-8 (CCK-8) was used to observe cell viability. qPCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the effect of PUR on the generation of extracellular matrix (ECM), ferroptosis and iron homeostasis in
vitro and in vivo. PUR markedly improved glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as alleviated renal dysfunction in diabetic nephropathy rats. Pharmacophore matching and enrichment analysis predicted the anti-DN effect of PUR may correlate with ECM. Experimental validation suggested that PUR treatment
could inhibit the generation of ECM to alleviate high-glucose-induced cell impairments, suppressing ROS production and excessive collagen fiber accumulation in GMSs, and reduce mesangial matrix expansion and renal fibrosis in type 2 DN rats. Further study suggested that PUR protected GMCs against
ferroptosis via reducing LDH release and GSH disruption, suppressing key regulators of two pathways for ferroptosis execution. Moreover, PUR also maintained iron metabolism hemostasis by regulating iron transportation proteins, iron exporter proteins, and iron storage proteins and reducing
intracellular iron in type 2 DN rats. PUR inhibited excessive ECM accumulation to protect against type 2 diabetic nephropathy, which meditated by regulating iron homeostasis and mitigating ferroptosis. This study provides promising therapeutics for diabetic nephropathy treatment.",1
25498386,"Experimental validation of plant peroxisomal targeting prediction algorithms by systematic comparison of in vivo import efficiency and in vitro PTS1 binding affinity.. Most peroxisomal matrix proteins possess a C-terminal targeting signal type 1 (PTS1). Accurate prediction of functional PTS1 sequences and their relative strength by computational methods is essential for determination of peroxisomal proteomes in silico but has proved challenging due to
high levels of sequence variability of non-canonical targeting signals, particularly in higher plants, and low levels of availability of experimentally validated non-canonical examples. In this study, in silico predictions were compared with in vivo targeting analyses and in vitro thermodynamic
binding of mutated variants within the context of one model targeting sequence. There was broad agreement between the methods for entire PTS1 domains and position-specific single amino acid residues, including residues upstream of the PTS1 tripeptide. The hierarchy Leu>Met>Ile>Val at the C-terminal
position was determined for all methods but both experimental approaches suggest that Tyr is underweighted in the prediction algorithm due to the absence of this residue in the positive training dataset. A combination of methods better defines the score range that discriminates a functional PTS1. In
vitro binding to the PEX5 receptor could discriminate among strong targeting signals while in vivo targeting assays were more sensitive, allowing detection of weak functional import signals that were below the limit of detection in the binding assay. Together, the data provide a comprehensive
assessment of the factors driving PTS1 efficacy and provide a framework for the more quantitative assessment of the protein import pathway in higher plants.",1
32634082,"Genome-wide Core Proteome Analysis of Brucella melitensis Strains for Potential Drug Target Prediction.. Brucella melitensis is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes abortion in goats and sheep and Malta fever in humans. In humans, chronic infection occurs through contact with infected animals or their waste products. The subtractive genomic approach is considered as a
powerful and useful method for the identification of potential drug and vaccine targets. In this study, an attempt has been made through a subtractive proteomic strategy to identify novel drug targets in Brucella melitensis strains. Total 2604 core proteins of 56 strains of B. melitensis were taken,
of which 545 non-human homologs were found to be essential for pathogen growth. Metabolic pathway analysis of these essential proteins revealed that 129 proteins are exclusively involved in 21 unique metabolic pathways in B. melitensis reference strain. Of these, 31 proteins were found to be
involved in 10 metabolic pathways that are unique to the pathogen. We selected Nitrate reductase subunit-β, Urease subunit α-2, Pantoate-β-alanine ligase, Isochorismatase, 2-dehydro-3-deoxyphosphooctonate aldolase and Serine O-acetyltransferase as drug targets in Brucella melitensis strains. Among
these druggable targets, we selected only Pantoate-β- alanine ligase as high confidence target based on intensive literature curation, which is nonhomologous to the human gut metagenome involved in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites pathway. Pantothenate synthetase is the best chemotherapeutic
target to combat Brucellulosis. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo validation is needed for the evaluation of lead compounds against Brucella melitensis strains.",0
35990651,"Exploring whole proteome to contrive multi-epitope-based vaccine for NeoCoV: An immunoinformtics and <i>in-silico</i> approach.. Neo-Coronavirus (NeoCoV) is a novel Betacoronavirus (β-CoVs or Beta-CoVs) discovered in bat specimens in South Africa during 2011. The viral sequence is highly similar to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, particularly that of structural proteins. Thus, scientists have emphasized the threat
posed by NeoCoV associated with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) usage, which could lead to a high death rate and faster transmission rate in humans. The development of a NeoCoV vaccine could provide a promising option for the future control of the virus in case of human infection. <i>In
silico</i> predictions can decrease the number of experiments required, making the immunoinformatics approaches cost-effective and convenient. Herein, with the aid of immunoinformatics and reverse vaccinology, we aimed to formulate a multi-epitope vaccine that may be used to prevent and treat NeoCoV
infection. Based on the NeoCoV proteins, B-cell, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), and helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes were shortlisted. Four vaccines (Neo-1-4) were devised by fusing shortlisted epitopes with appropriate adjuvants and linkers. The secondary and three-dimensional structures of final
vaccines were then predicted. The binding interactions of these potential vaccines with toll-like immune receptors (TLR-2, TLR-3, and TLR-4) and major histocompatibility complex molecules (MHC-I and II) reveal that they properly fit into the receptors' binding domains. Besides, Neo-1 and Neo-4
vaccines exhibited better docking energies of -101.08 kcal/mol and -114.47 kcal/mol, respectively, with TLR-3 as compared to other vaccine constructs. The constructed vaccines are highly antigenic, non-allergenic, soluble, non-toxic, and topologically assessable with good physiochemical
characteristics. Codon optimization and <i>in-silico</i> cloning confirmed efficient expression of the designed vaccines in <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain K12. <i>In-silico</i> immune simulation indicated that Neo-1 and Neo-4 vaccines could induce a strong immune response against NeoCoV. Lastly, the
binding stability and strong binding affinity of Neo-1 and Neo-4 with TLR-3 receptor were validated using molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations (Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area method). The final vaccines require experimental validation to establish their
safety and effectiveness in preventing NeoCoV infections.",0
37679724,"SubMDTA: drug target affinity prediction based on substructure extraction and multi-scale features.. Drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction is a critical step in the field of drug discovery. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have emerged for DTA prediction. In order to solve the problem of fusion of substructure information of drug molecular graphs and utilize multi-scale
information of protein, a self-supervised pre-training model based on substructure extraction and multi-scale features is proposed in this paper. For drug molecules, the model obtains substructure information through the method of probability matrix, and the contrastive learning method is
implemented on the graph-level representation and subgraph-level representation to pre-train the graph encoder for downstream tasks. For targets, a BiLSTM method that integrates multi-scale features is used to capture long-distance relationships in the amino acid sequence. The experimental results
showed that our model achieved better performance for DTA prediction. The proposed model improves the performance of the DTA prediction, which provides a novel strategy based on substructure extraction and multi-scale features.",0
36083952,"Modality-DTA: Multimodality Fusion Strategy for Drug-Target Affinity Prediction.. Prediction of the drug-target affinity (DTA) plays an important role in drug discovery. Existing deep learning methods for DTA prediction typically leverage a single modality, namely simplified molecular input line entry specification (SMILES) or amino acid sequence to learn
representations. SMILES or amino acid sequences can be encoded into different modalities. Multimodality data provide different kinds of information, with complementary roles for DTA prediction. We propose Modality-DTA, a novel deep learning method for DTA prediction that leverages the multimodality
of drugs and targets. A group of backward propagation neural networks is applied to ensure the completeness of the reconstruction process from the latent feature representation to original multimodality data. The tag between the drug and target is used to reduce the noise information in the latent
representation from multimodality data. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our Modality-DTA outperforms existing methods in all metrics. Modality-DTA reduces the mean square error by 15.7% and improves the area under the precisionrecall curve by 12.74% in the Davis dataset. We further
find that the drug modality Morgan fingerprint and the target modality generated by one-hot-encoding play the most significant roles. To the best of our knowledge, Modality-DTA is the first method to explore multimodality for DTA prediction.",0
