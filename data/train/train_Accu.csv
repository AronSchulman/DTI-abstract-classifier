LDS-CNN: a deep learning framework for drug-target interactions prediction based on large-scale drug screening.,37667773,"Drug-target interaction (DTI) is a vital drug design strategy that plays a significant role in many processes of complex diseases and cellular events. In the face of challenges such as extensive protein data and experimental costs, it is suggested to apply bioinformatics approaches to
exploit potential interactions to design new targeted medications. Different data and interaction types bring difficulties to study involving incompatible and heterology formats. The analysis of drug-target interactions in a comprehensive and unified model is a significant challenge. Here, we
propose a general method for predicting interactions between small-molecule drugs and protein targets, Large-scale Drug target Screening Convolutional Neural Network (LDS-CNN), which used unified encoding to achieve the calculation of the different data formats in an integrated model to realize

Overfit deep neural network for predicting drug-target interactions.,37680476,"Drug-target interactions (DTIs) prediction is an important step in drug discovery. As traditional biological experiments or high-throughput screening are high cost and time-consuming, many deep learning models have been developed. Overfitting must be avoided when training deep learning

representation of the nonlinear relationship between drugs and targets. Performance of OverfitDTI on three public datasets showed that the overfit DNN models fit the nonlinear relationship with high accuracy. We identified fifteen compounds that interacted with TEK, a receptor tyrosine kinase

Logistic matrix factorisation and generative adversarial neural network-based method for predicting drug-target interactions.,34297278,"Identifying drug-target protein association pairs is a prerequisite and a crucial task in drug discovery and development.

Multitype Perception Method for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction.,37314917,"With the growing popularity of artificial intelligence in drug discovery, many deep-learning technologies have been used to automatically predict unknown drug-target interactions (DTIs). A unique challenge in using these technologies to predict DTI is fully exploiting the knowledge
diversity across different interaction types, such as drug-drug, drug-target, drug-enzyme, drug-path, and drug-structure types. Unfortunately, existing methods tend to learn the specifical knowledge on each interaction type and they usually ignore the knowledge diversity across different interaction
types. Therefore, we propose a multitype perception method (MPM) for DTI prediction by exploiting knowledge diversity across different link types. The method consists of two main components: a type perceptor and a multitype predictor. The type perceptor learns distinguished edge representations by
retaining the specifical features across different interaction types; this maximizes the prediction performance for each interaction type. The multitype predictor calculates the type similarity between the type perceptor and predicted interactions, and the domain gate module is reconstructed to
assign an adaptive weight to each type perceptor.

In silico analysis predicting effects of deleterious SNPs of human RASSF5 gene on its structure and functions.,32884013,"Ras association domain-containing protein 5 (RASSF5), one of the prospective biomarkers for tumors, generally plays a crucial role as a tumor suppressor.

altered protein-protein interactions that encompass various cascades of signals. Out of all the SNPs obtained from the NCBI database, only 25 were considered as highly deleterious by six in silico SNP prediction tools. Among them, upon analyzing the effect of these nsSNPs on the stability of the
protein, we found 17 SNPs that decrease the stability. Significant deviation in the energy minimization score was observed in P350R, F321L, and R277W.

Identifying drug-target interactions based on graph convolutional network and deep neural network.,32367110,"Identification of new drug-target interactions (DTIs) is an important but a time-consuming and costly step in drug discovery.

multiple drugs and proteins in which DPPs are the nodes and the associations between DPPs are the edges of the network. We then propose a novel learning-based framework, 'graph convolutional network (GCN)-DTI', for DTI identification. The model first uses a graph convolutional network to learn the

apoptosis, and downregulate the mRNA expression of 5 hub genes by inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway activation. The most predominant component of SBG against OLK was baicalein and the key pathway was PI3K/Akt. The main components and hub genes had robust binding abilities. In vitro experiments
showed that baicalein could inhibit the proliferation of DOK cells, induce apoptosis, block the cell cycle, and inhibit the mRNA expression level of the hub genes by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway."
A Machine Learning Approach for Drug-target Interaction Prediction using Wrapper Feature Selection and Class Balancing.,32003548,"Drug-Target interaction (DTI) plays a crucial role in drug discovery, drug repositioning and understanding the drug side effects which helps to identify new therapeutic profiles for various diseases.

face the problem of class imbalance. Therefore, in this study we address two challenges faced by such datasets, i. e., class imbalance and high dimensionality to develop a predictive model for DTI prediction. The study is carried out on four protein classes namely Enzyme, Ion Channel, G
Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCR) and Nuclear Receptor. We encoded the target protein sequence using the dipeptide composition and drug with a molecular descriptor. A machine learning approach is employed to predict the DTI using wrapper feature selection and synthetic minority oversampling technique

The prediction of potential drug-target interactions (DTIs) not only provides a better comprehension of biological processes but also is critical for identifying new drugs. However, due to the disadvantages of expensive and high time-consuming traditional experiments, only a small section
of interactions between drugs and targets in the database were verified experimentally. Therefore, it is meaningful and important to develop new computational methods with good performance for DTIs prediction. At present, many existing computational methods only utilize the single type of
interactions between drugs and proteins without paying attention to the associations and influences with other types of molecules. In this work, we developed a novel network embedding-based heterogeneous information integration model to predict potential drug-target interactions. Firstly, a

DrugMiner: comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms for prediction of potential druggable proteins.,26821132,"Application of computational methods in drug discovery has received increased attention in recent years as a way to accelerate drug target prediction. Based on 443 sequence-derived protein features, we applied the most commonly used machine learning methods to predict whether a protein is
druggable as well as to opt for superior algorithm in this task. In addition, feature selection procedures were used to provide the best performance of each classifier according to the optimum number of features. When run on all features, Neural Network was the best classifier, with 89.98% accuracy,
based on a k-fold cross-validation test. Among all the algorithms applied, the optimum number of most-relevant features was 130, according to the Support Vector Machine-Feature Selection (SVM-FS) algorithm. This study resulted in the discovery of new drug target which potentially can be employed in
cell signaling pathways, gene expression, and signal transduction.

Drug Target Group Prediction with Multiple Drug Networks.,31267864,"Identification of drug-target interaction is essential in drug discovery. It is beneficial to predict unexpected therapeutic or adverse side effects of drugs. To date, several computational methods have been proposed to predict drug-target interactions because they are prompt and low-cost

A multi-label classification model was presented to assign drugs into correct target groups. To make
full use of the known drug properties, five networks were constructed, each of which represented drug associations in one property. A powerful network embedding method, Mashup, was adopted to extract drug features from above-mentioned networks, based on which several machine learning algorithms,
including RAndom k-labELsets (RAKEL) algorithm, Label Powerset (LP) algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were used to build the classification model. Tenfold cross-validation yielded the accuracy of 0.839, exact match of 0.816 and hamming loss of 0.037, indicating good performance of the

Predicting Drug-Target Affinity by Learning Protein Knowledge From Biological Networks.,37018115,"Predicting drug-target affinity (DTA) is a crucial step in the process of drug discovery. Efficient and accurate prediction of DTA would greatly reduce the time and economic cost of new drug development, which has encouraged the emergence of a large number of deep learning-based DTA

However, both two approaches focused only on the inherent properties of the target protein, but neglected the broad prior knowledge regarding
protein interactions that have been clearly elucidated in past decades. Aiming at the above issue, this work presents an end-to-end DTA prediction method named MSF-DTA (Multi-Source Feature Fusion-based Drug-Target Affinity). The contributions can be summarized as follows. First, MSF-DTA adopts a
novel ""neighboring feature""-based protein representation. Instead of utilizing only the inherent features of a target protein, MSF-DTA gathers additional information for the target protein from its biologically related ""neighboring"" proteins in PPI (i.e., protein-protein interaction) and SSN (i.e.,
sequence similarity) networks to get prior knowledge. Second, the representation was learned using an advanced graph pre-training framework, VGAE, which could not only gather node features but also learn topological connections, therefore contributing to a richer protein representation and
benefiting the downstream DTA prediction task.

such as self-training support vector machine (SVM) and BLM, to develop a self-training bipartite local model (SELF-BLM) that facilitates the identification of potential interactions. The method first categorizes unlabeled interactions and negative interactions among unknown interactions using a
clustering method. Then, using the BLM method and self-training SVM, the unlabeled interactions are self-trained and final local classification models are constructed. When applied to four classes of proteins that include enzymes, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and nuclear
