DeepStack-DTIs: Predicting Drug-Target Interactions Using LightGBM Feature Selection and Deep-Stacked Ensemble Classifier.,34731411,"Accurate prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs), which is often used in the fields of drug discovery and drug repositioning, is regarded a key challenge in the study of drug science. In this paper, a new method called DeepStack-DTIs is proposed to predict DTIs. First, for the target protein, pseudo-position specific score matrix, pseudo amino acid composition and SPIDER3 are used to extract the different feature information of the target protein. Meanwhile, the path-based fingerprint features of each drug are extracted.

Novel drug-target interactions via link prediction and network embedding.,35379165,"As many interactions between the chemical and genomic space remain undiscovered, computational methods able to identify potential drug-target interactions (DTIs) are employed to accelerate drug discovery and reduce the required cost. Predicting new DTIs can leverage drug repurposing by identifying new targets for approved drugs. However, developing an accurate computational framework that can efficiently incorporate chemical and genomic spaces remains extremely demanding. A key issue is that most DTI predictions suffer from the lack of experimentally validated negative interactions or limited availability of target 3D structures. We report DT2Vec, a pipeline for DTI prediction based on graph embedding and gradient boosted tree classification. It maps drug-drug and protein-protein similarity networks to low-dimensional features and the DTI prediction is formulated as binary classification based on a strategy of concatenating the drug and target embedding vectors as input features. DT2Vec was compared with three top-performing graph similarity-based algorithms on a standard benchmark dataset and achieved competitive results. In order to explore credible novel DTIs, the model was applied to data from the ChEMBL repository that contain experimentally validated positive and negative interactions which yield a strong predictive model. Then, the developed model was applied to all possible unknown DTIs to predict new interactions. The applicability of DT2Vec as an effective method for drug repurposing is discussed through case studies and evaluation of some novel DTI predictions is undertaken using molecular docking. The proposed method was able to integrate and map chemical and genomic space into low-dimensional dense vectors and showed promising results in predicting novel DTIs.",1,"Novel drug-target interactions via link prediction and network embedding.

GraphDTA: predicting drug-target binding affinity with graph neural networks.,33119053,"The development of new drugs is costly, time consuming and often accompanied with safety issues. Drug repurposing can avoid the expensive and lengthy process of drug development by finding new uses for already approved drugs.

Computational models that estimate the interaction strength of new drug-target pairs have the potential to expedite drug repurposing. Several models have been proposed for this task.

Explaining Black Box Drug Target Prediction Through Model Agnostic Counterfactual Samples.,35820003,"Many high-performance DTA deep learning models have been proposed, but they are mostly black-box and thus lack human interpretability.

Benchmarking the Predictive Power of Ligand Efficiency Indices in QSAR.,27399907,"Compound physicochemical properties favoring in vitro potency are not always correlated to desirable pharmacokinetic profiles. Therefore, using potency (i.e., IC50) as the main criterion to prioritize candidate drugs at early stage drug discovery campaigns has been questioned. Yet, the vast majority of the virtual screening models reported in the medicinal chemistry literature predict the biological activity of compounds by regressing in vitro potency on topological or physicochemical descriptors. Two studies published in this journal showed that higher predictive power on external molecules can be achieved by using ligand efficiency indices as the dependent variable instead of a metric of potency (IC50) or binding affinity (Ki). The present study aims at filling the shortage of a thorough assessment of the predictive power of ligand efficiency indices in QSAR. To this aim, the predictive power of 11 ligand efficiency indices has been benchmarked across four algorithms (Gradient Boosting Machines, Partial Least Squares, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines), two descriptor types (Morgan fingerprints, and physicochemical descriptors), and 29 data sets collected from the literature and ChEMBL database. Ligand efficiency metrics led to the highest predictive power on external molecules irrespective of the descriptor type or algorithm used, with an R(2)test difference of ∼0.3 units and a this difference ∼0.4 units when modeling small data sets and a normalized RMSE decrease of >0.1 units in some cases. Polarity indices, such as SEI and NSEI, led to higher predictive power than metrics based on molecular size, i.e., BEI, NBEI, and LE. LELP, which comprises a polarity factor (cLogP) and a size parameter (LE) constantly led to the most predictive models, suggesting that these two properties convey a complementary predictive signal.

Explainable deep drug-target representations for binding affinity prediction.,35715734,"Several computational advances have been achieved in the drug discovery field, promoting the identification of novel drug-target interactions and new leads. However, most of these methodologies have been overlooking the importance of providing explanations to the decision-making process of deep learning architectures.

Exploration and validation of key genes associated with early lymph node metastasis in thyroid carcinoma using weighted gene co-expression network analysis and machine learning.,38144565,"Background: Thyroid carcinoma (THCA), the most common endocrine neoplasm, typically exhibits an indolent behavior. However, in some instances, lymph node metastasis (LNM) may occur in the early stages, with the underlying mechanisms not yet fully understood. Materials and methods: LNM potential was defined as the tumor's capability to metastasize to lymph nodes at an early stage, even when the tumor volume is small. We performed differential expression analysis using the 'Limma' R package and conducted enrichment analyses using the Metascape tool. Co-expression networks were established using the 'WGCNA' R package, with the soft threshold power determined by the 'pickSoftThreshold' algorithm. For unsupervised clustering, we utilized the 'ConsensusCluster Plus' R package. To determine the topological features and degree centralities of each node (protein) within the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network, we used the CytoNCA plugin integrated with the Cytoscape tool. Immune cell infiltration was assessed using the Immune Cell Abundance Identifier (ImmuCellAI) database. We applied the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) algorithms individually, with the 'glmnet,' 'e1071,' and 'randomForest' R packages, respectively. Ridge regression was performed using the 'oncoPredict' algorithm, and all the predictions were based on data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database. To ascertain the protein expression levels and subcellular localization of genes, we consulted the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. Molecular docking was carried out using the mcule 1-click Docking server online. Experimental validation of gene and protein expression levels was conducted through Real-Time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. Results: Through WGCNA and PPI network analysis, we identified twelve hub genes as the most relevant to LNM potential from these two modules. These 12 hub genes displayed differential expression in THCA and exhibited significant correlations with the downregulation of neutrophil infiltration, as well as the upregulation of dendritic cell and macrophage infiltration, along with activation of the EMT pathway in THCA. We propose a novel molecular classification approach and provide an online web-based nomogram for evaluating the LNM potential of THCA (http://www.empowerstats.net/pmodel/?m=17617_LNM). Machine learning algorithms have identified ERBB3 as the most critical gene associated with LNM potential in THCA. ERBB3 exhibits high expression in patients with THCA who have experienced LNM or have advanced-stage disease. The differential methylation levels partially explain this differential expression of ERBB3. ROC analysis has identified ERBB3 as a diagnostic marker for THCA (AUC=0.89), THCA with high LNM potential (AUC=0.75), and lymph nodes with tumor metastasis (AUC=0.86).

A stabilized retro-inverso peptide ligand of transferrin receptor for enhanced liposome-based hepatocellular carcinoma-targeted drug delivery.,30395963,"The application of tumor targeting ligands to the treatment of cancer holds promise for improving efficacy and reducing toxicity. LT7 (L(HAIYPRH)) peptide, a phage display-selected peptide, exhibited high binding affinity to transferrin receptor (TfR) overexpressed on tumor cells. However, its in vivo tumor targeting efficiency was impaired due to enzymatic degradation in blood circulation. To improve the stability and targeting ability, a retro-inverso analogue of LT7 peptide, named DT7 peptide (D(HRPYIAH)), was designed for targeted therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma. The result of computer simulation predicted that DT7 bound to TfR protein more efficiently than LT7, and this prediction was confirmed experimentally by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Ex vivo stability experiment demonstrated that DT7 possessed stronger ability against proteolysis than LT7 in fresh mouse serum. We further prepared DT7-, LT7-, and transferrin (Tf)-modified liposomes (DT7-LIP, LT7-LIP, and Tf-LIP, respectively). DT7-LIP showed a significantly stronger in vitro targeting ability than LT7-LIP and Tf-LIP under normal condition and simulated biological condition. In addition, the in vitro antitumor effect of DTX-loaded DT7-LIP was markedly enhanced in comparison to DTX-loaded LT7-LIP and DTX-loaded Tf-LIP. In vivo imaging indicated that DT7-LIP had better tumor accumulation than LT7-LIP and Tf-LIP. For in vivo antitumor studies, the tumor growth rate of mice treated with DTX-loaded DT7-LIP was significantly inhibited compared to that in mice treated with DTX-loaded LT7-LIP and DTX-loaded Tf-LIP. Overall, this study verified the potential of the stable DT7 peptide in improving the efficacy of docetaxel in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: A phage display library-selected LT7 (L(HAIYPRH)) peptide exhibited high affinity to transferrin receptor (TfR). However, its bioactivity was impaired in vivo as L-peptides are susceptible to degradation by proteolytic enzymes.

The application of tumor targeting ligands to the treatment of cancer holds promise for improving efficacy and reducing toxicity. LT7 (L(HAIYPRH)) peptide, a phage display-selected peptide, exhibited high binding affinity to transferrin receptor (TfR) overexpressed on tumor cells. However, its in vivo tumor targeting efficiency was impaired due to enzymatic degradation in blood circulation. To improve the stability and targeting ability, a retro-inverso analogue of LT7 peptide, named DT7 peptide (D(HRPYIAH)), was designed for targeted therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma. The result of computer simulation predicted that DT7 bound to TfR protein more efficiently than LT7, and this prediction was confirmed experimentally by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Ex vivo stability experiment demonstrated that DT7 possessed stronger ability against proteolysis than LT7 in fresh mouse serum. We further prepared DT7-, LT7-, and transferrin (Tf)-modified liposomes (DT7-LIP, LT7-LIP, and Tf-LIP, respectively). DT7-LIP showed a significantly stronger in vitro targeting ability than LT7-LIP and Tf-LIP under normal condition and simulated biological condition. In addition, the in vitro antitumor effect of DTX-loaded DT7-LIP was markedly enhanced in comparison to DTX-loaded LT7-LIP and DTX-loaded Tf-LIP. In vivo imaging indicated that DT7-LIP had better tumor accumulation than LT7-LIP and Tf-LIP. For in vivo antitumor studies, the tumor growth rate of mice treated with DTX-loaded DT7-LIP was significantly inhibited compared to that in mice treated with DTX-loaded LT7-LIP and DTX-loaded Tf-LIP. Overall, this study verified the potential of the stable DT7 peptide in improving the efficacy of docetaxel in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: A phage display library-selected LT7 (L(HAIYPRH)) peptide exhibited high affinity to transferrin receptor (TfR). However, its bioactivity was impaired in vivo as L-peptides are susceptible to degradation by proteolytic enzymes. Here, we designed a retro-inverso peptide DT7(D(HRPYIAH)) and demonstrated its increased serum stability and higher binding affinity to TfR. A stabilized targeted drug delivery system was further constructed by modified DT7 peptide on the surface of liposomes. The data indicated that DT7 peptide-modified liposomes exhibited higher targeting ability in vitro and in vivo.

Drug-Target Interaction Prediction Using Multi-Head Self-Attention and Graph Attention Network.,33956632,"Identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) is an important step in the process of new drug discovery and drug repositioning. Accurate predictions for DTIs can improve the efficiency in the drug discovery and development. Although rapid advances in deep learning technologies have generated various computational methods, it is still appealing to further investigate how to design efficient networks for predicting DTIs. In this study, we propose an end-to-end deep learning method (called MHSADTI) to predict DTIs based on the graph attention network and multi-head self-attention mechanism. First, the characteristics of drugs and proteins are extracted by the graph attention network and multi-head self-attention mechanism, respectively. Then, the attention scores are used to consider which amino acid subsequence in a protein is more important for the drug to predict its interactions. Finally, we predict DTIs by a fully connected layer after obtaining the feature vectors of drugs and proteins. MHSADTI takes advantage of self-attention mechanism for obtaining long-dependent contextual relationship in amino acid sequences and predicting DTI interpretability. More effective molecular characteristics are also obtained by the attention mechanism in graph attention networks. Multiple cross validation experiments are adopted to assess the performance of our MHSADTI.

Identification of a minimum number of genes to predict triple-negative breast cancer subgroups from gene expression profiles.,36536459,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a very heterogeneous disease.

However, the systematic analysis of its mechanism has not been carried out yet and further studies are needed to reveal the role of SZC. Methods: A systematic network pharmacology analysis was conducted by integrating construction of SZC compound database and AM target database, prediction of potential active compounds and targets by molecular docking combined with compound-target prediction graph (CTPG), protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Then, the anti-inflammation experiments in vitro were performed by investigating SZC and the representative compounds regulating nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10). Results: Our findings show that SZC mainly treated AM by stimulating 28 core targets through 30 key potential active compounds, and affecting 4 crucial pathways. The treatment was associated with inflammation reaction, hormone regulation, cell adhesion, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Additionally, SZC achieved the anti-inflammatory activity by the cooperation of the compounds through inhibiting NO and IL-6, both promoting and inhibiting IL-10. Conclusion: This study investigated the anti-inflammatory activity of SZC based on a systematic analysis of SZC remedying AM, which was revealed to be one of the essential mechanisms. These findings will provide valuable guidance for further research of the SZC treatment of AM, and help improve the comprehension of SZC pharmacological basis as well as AM pathogenesis.",0,"Anti-Inflammatory Activity of Sanjie Zhentong Capsule Assessed By Network Pharmacology Analysis of Adenomyosis Treatment.

A Robust Drug-Target Interaction Prediction Framework with Capsule Network and Transfer Learning.,37762364,"Drug-target interactions (DTIs) are considered a crucial component of drug design and drug discovery. To date, many computational methods were developed for drug-target interactions, but they are insufficiently informative for accurately predicting DTIs due to the lack of experimentally verified negative datasets, inaccurate molecular feature representation, and ineffective DTI classifiers. Therefore, we address the limitations of randomly selecting negative DTI data from unknown drug-target pairs by establishing two experimentally validated datasets and propose a capsule network-based framework called CapBM-DTI to capture hierarchical relationships of drugs and targets, which adopts pre-trained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) for contextual sequence feature extraction from target proteins through transfer learning and the message-passing neural network (MPNN) for the 2-D graph feature extraction of compounds to accurately and robustly identify drug-target interactions. We compared the performance of CapBM-DTI with state-of-the-art methods using four experimentally validated DTI datasets of different sizes, including human (<i>Homo sapiens</i>) and worm (<i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>) species datasets, as well as three subsets (new compounds, new proteins, and new pairs).

AttentionDTA: Drug-Target Binding Affinity Prediction by Sequence-Based Deep Learning With Attention Mechanism.,35471889,"The identification of drug-target relations (DTRs) is substantial in drug development. A large number of methods treat DTRs as drug-target interactions (DTIs), a binary classification problem. The main drawback of these methods are the lack of reliable negative samples and the absence of many important aspects of DTR, including their dose dependence and quantitative affinities. With increasing number of publications of drug-protein binding affinity data recently, DTRs prediction can be viewed as a regression problem of drug-target affinities (DTAs) which reflects how tightly the drug binds to the target and can present more detailed and specific information than DTIs. The growth of affinity data enables the use of deep learning architectures, which have been shown to be among the state-of-the-art methods in binding affinity prediction. Although relatively effective, due to the black-box nature of deep learning, these models are less biologically interpretable. In this study, we proposed a deep learning-based model, named AttentionDTA, which uses attention mechanism to predict DTAs. Different from the models using 3D structures of drug-target complexes or graph representation of drugs and proteins, the novelty of our work is to use attention mechanism to focus on key subsequences which are important in drug and protein sequences when predicting its affinity. We use two separate one-dimensional Convolution Neural Networks (1D-CNNs) to extract the semantic information of drug's SMILES string and protein's amino acid sequence. Furthermore, a two-side multi-head attention mechanism is developed and embedded to our model to explore the relationship between drug features and protein features. We evaluate our model on three established DTA benchmark datasets, Davis, Metz, and KIBA. AttentionDTA outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning methods under different evaluation metrics. The results show that the attention-based model can effectively extract protein features related to drug information and drug features related to protein information to better predict drug target affinities. It is worth mentioning that we test our model on IC50 dataset, which provides the binding sites between drugs and proteins, to evaluate the ability of our model to locate binding sites. Finally, we visualize the attention weight to demonstrate the biological significance of the model.

Instead of utilizing only the inherent features of a target protein, MSF-DTA gathers additional information for the target protein from its biologically related ""neighboring"" proteins in PPI (i.e., protein-protein interaction) and SSN (i.e., sequence similarity) networks to get prior knowledge. Second, the representation was learned using an advanced graph pre-training framework, VGAE, which could not only gather node features but also learn topological connections, therefore contributing to a richer protein representation and benefiting the downstream DTA prediction task. This study provides new perspective for the DTA prediction task, and evaluation results demonstrated that MSF-DTA obtained superior performances compared to current state-of-the-art methods."
How to approach machine learning-based prediction of drug/compound-target interactions.,36747300,"The identification of drug/compound-target interactions (DTIs) constitutes the basis of drug discovery, for which computational predictive approaches have been developed. As a relatively new data-driven paradigm, proteochemometric (PCM) modeling utilizes both protein and compound properties as a pair at the input level and processes them via statistical/machine learning. The representation of input samples (i.e., proteins and their ligands) in the form of quantitative feature vectors is crucial for the extraction of interaction-related properties during the artificial learning and subsequent prediction of DTIs. Lately, the representation learning approach, in which input samples are automatically featurized via training and applying a machine/deep learning model, has been utilized in biomedical sciences. In this study, we performed a comprehensive investigation of different computational approaches/techniques for protein featurization (including both conventional approaches and the novel learned embeddings), data preparation and exploration, machine learning-based modeling, and performance evaluation with the aim of achieving better data representations and more successful learning in DTI prediction. For this, we first constructed realistic and challenging benchmark datasets on small, medium, and large scales to be used as reliable gold standards for specific DTI modeling tasks. We developed and applied a network analysis-based splitting strategy to divide datasets into structurally different training and test folds. Using these datasets together with various featurization methods, we trained and tested DTI prediction models and evaluated their performance from different angles. Our main findings can be summarized under 3 items: (i) random splitting of datasets into train and test folds leads to near-complete data memorization and produce highly over-optimistic results, as a result, should be avoided, (ii) learned protein sequence embeddings work well in DTI prediction and offer high potential, despite interaction-related properties (e.g., structures) of proteins are unused during their self-supervised model training, and (iii) during the learning process, PCM models tend to rely heavily on compound features while partially ignoring protein features, primarily due to the inherent bias in DTI data, indicating the requirement for new and unbiased datasets. We hope this study will aid researchers in designing robust and high-performing data-driven DTI prediction systems that have real-world translational value in drug discovery.",1,"How to approach machine learning-based prediction of drug/compound-target interactions.

Drug-target affinity prediction method based on multi-scale information interaction and graph optimization.,37907030,"Drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction as an emerging and effective method is widely applied to explore the strength of drug-target interactions in drug development research.

However, existing DTA prediction models mainly use graphical representations of drug molecules, which lack information on interactions between individual substructures, thus affecting prediction accuracy and model interpretability. Therefore, transformer and diffusion on drug graphs in DTA prediction (TDGraphDTA) are introduced to predict drug-target interactions using multi-scale information interaction and graph optimization. An interactive module is integrated into feature extraction of drug and target features at different granularity levels. A diffusion model-based graph optimization module is proposed to improve the representation of molecular graph structures and enhance the interpretability of graph representations while obtaining optimal feature representations.

Using BERT to identify drug-target interactions from whole PubMed.,35729494,"Drug-target interactions (DTIs) are critical for drug repurposing and elucidation of drug mechanisms, and are manually curated by large databases, such as ChEMBL, BindingDB, DrugBank and DrugTargetCommons.

Finding such articles and extracting the experimental information is a challenging task, and there is a pressing need for systematic approaches to assist the curation of DTIs. To this end, we applied Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to identify such articles. Because DTI data intimately depends on the type of assays used to generate it, we also aimed to incorporate functions to predict the assay format.

Using 10-fold cross-validation, we obtained ~ 99% accuracy for identifying articles containing quantitative drug-target profiles.

Instead, a protein is characterized completely by the ligands that it interacts. Specifically, we treat different proteins separately, which are jointly trained in a multi-head manner, so as to learn a robust and universal representation of ligands that is generalizable across proteins.

Decyl Gallate as a Possible Inhibitor of N-Glycosylation Process in Paracoccidioides lutzii.,31451502,"The available antifungal therapeutic arsenal is limited.

In this work, to evaluate the antifungal characteristics of G14 for Paracoccidioides lutzii, a chemical-genetic interaction analysis was conducted on a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model. N-glycosylation and/or the unfolded protein response pathway was identified as a high-confidence process for drug target prediction. The overactivation of unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling was confirmed using this model with IRE1/ATF6/PERK genes tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP). In P. lutzii, this prediction was confirmed by the low activity of glycosylated enzymes [α-(1,3)-glucanase, N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAGase), and α-(1,4)-amylase], by hyperexpression of genes involved with the UPR and glycosylated enzymes, and by the reduction in the amounts of glycosylated proteins and chitin. All of these components are involved in fungal cell wall integrity and are dependent on the N-glycosylation process. This loss of integrity was confirmed by the reduction in mitochondrial activity, impaired budding, enhancement of wall permeability, and a decrease in viability. These events led to a reduction of the ability of fungi to adhere on human lung epithelial cells (A549) in vitro Therefore, G14 may have an important role in balancing the inflammatory reaction caused by fungal infection, without interfering with the microbicidal activity of nitric oxide.

Efficient function of signal peptidase 1 of Escherichia coli is partly determined by residues in the mature N-terminus of exported proteins.,30849301,"Exported proteins require an N-terminal signal peptide to direct them from the cytoplasm to the periplasm. Once the protein has been translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane, the signal peptide is cleaved by a signal peptidase, allowing the remainder of the protein to fold into its mature state in the periplasm. Signal peptidase I (LepB) cleaves non-lipoproteins and recognises the sequence Ala-X-Ala. Amino acids present at the N-terminus of mature, exported proteins have been shown to affect the efficiency at which the protein is exported. Here we investigated a bias against aromatic amino acids at the second position in the mature protein (P2'). Maltose binding protein (MBP) was mutated to introduce aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine) at P2'. All mutants with aromatic amino acids at P2' were exported less efficiently as indicated by a slight increase in precursor protein in vivo. Binding of LepB to peptides that encompass the MBP cleavage site were analysed using surface plasmon resonance. These studies showed peptides with an aromatic amino acid at P2' had a slower off rate, due to a significantly higher binding affinity for LepB. These data are consistent with the accumulation of small amounts of preMBP in purified protein samples. Hence, the reason for the lack of aromatic amino acids at P2' in E. coli is likely due to interference with efficient LepB activity. These data and previous bioinformatics strongly suggest that aromatic amino acids are not preferred at P2' and this should be incorporated into signal peptide prediction algorithms.",0,"Efficient function of signal peptidase 1 of Escherichia coli is partly determined by residues in the mature N-terminus of exported proteins.

Specific gene module pair-based target identification and drug discovery.,36726786,"Identification of the biological targets of a compound is of paramount importance for the exploration of the mechanism of action of drugs and for the development of novel drugs.

For a new query compound, the CMap-based method can infer its potential targets by searching similar drugs with known targets (reference drugs) and measuring the similarities into their specific transcriptional responses between the query compound and those reference drugs. However, the available methods are often inefficient due to the requirement of the reference drugs as a medium to link the query agent and targets.

Clinical potential of automated convolutional neural network-based hematoma volumetry after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.,37734180,"Objectives: Cerebrospinal fluid hemoglobin has been positioned as a potential biomarker and drug target for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage-related secondary brain injury (SAH-SBI). The maximum amount of hemoglobin, which may be released into the cerebrospinal fluid, is defined by the initial subarachnoid hematoma volume (ISHV). In patients without external ventricular or lumbar drain, there remains an unmet clinical need to predict the risk for SAH-SBI. The aim of this study was to explore automated segmentation of ISHV as a potential surrogate for cerebrospinal fluid hemoglobin to predict SAH-SBI. Methods: This study is based on a retrospective analysis of imaging and clinical data from 220 consecutive patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage collected over a five-year period. 127 annotated initial non-contrast CT scans were used to train and test a convolutional neural network to automatically segment the ISHV in the remaining cohort. Performance was reported in terms of Dice score and intraclass correlation. We characterized the associations between ISHV and baseline cohort characteristics, SAH-SBI, ventriculoperitoneal shunt dependence, functional outcome, and survival. Established clinical (World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies, Hunt & Hess) and radiological (modified Fisher, Barrow Neurological Institute) scores served as references. Results: A strong volume agreement (0.73 Dice, range 0.43 - 0.93) and intraclass correlation (0.89, 95% CI, 0.81-0.94) were shown. While ISHV was not associated with the use of antithrombotics or cardiovascular risk factors, there was strong evidence for an association with a lower Glasgow Coma Scale at hospital admission. Aneurysm size and location were not associated with ISHV, but the presence of intracerebral or intraventricular hemorrhage were independently associated with higher ISHV. Despite strong evidence for a positive association between ISHV and SAH-SBI, the discriminatory ability of ISHV for SAH-SBI was insufficient. The discriminatory ability of ISHV was, however, higher regarding ventriculoperitoneal shunt dependence and functional outcome at three-months follow-up. Multivariate survival analysis provided strong evidence for an independent negative association between survival probability and both ISHV and intraventricular hemorrhage. Conclusions: The proposed algorithm demonstrates strong performance in volumetric segmentation of the ISHV on the admission CT. While the discriminatory ability of ISHV for SAH-SBI was similar to established clinical and radiological scores, it showed a high discriminatory ability for ventriculoperitoneal shunt dependence and functional outcome at three-months follow-up.",0,"Clinical potential of automated convolutional neural network-based hematoma volumetry after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

A novel prognostic signature contributes to precision treatment in colon adenocarcinoma with KRAS mutation.,37310401,"Background: Approximately 40% of colon cancer harbor Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene ( KRAS ) mutations, but the prognostic value of KRAS mutations in colon cancer is still controversial. Methods: We enrolled 412 colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patients with KRAS mutations, 644 COAD patients with KRAS wild-type and 357 COAD patients lacking information on KRAS status from five independent cohorts. A random forest model was developed to estimate the KRAS status. The prognostic signature was established using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-Cox regression and evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, multivariate-Cox analysis, receiver operating characteristic curve and nomogram. The expression data of KRAS -mutant COAD cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database and the corresponding drug sensitivity data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database were used for potential target and agent exploration. Results: We established a 36-gene prognostic signature classifying the KRAS -mutant COAD as high and low risk. High risk patients had inferior prognoses compared to those with low risk, while the signature failed to distinguish the prognosis of COAD with KRAS wild-type. The risk score was the independent prognostic factor for KRAS -mutant COAD and we further fabricated the nomograms with good predictive efficiency.

The semi-supervised mechanism allows our model to learn proteins drugs features of both labeled and unlabeled data. We evaluate the performance of our method using multiple public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while utilizing freely available unlabeled data. Our results suggest that utilizing such unlabeled data can considerably help improve performance in various biomedical relation extraction processes, for example, Drug-Target interaction and protein-protein interaction, particularly when only limited labeled data are available in such tasks. To our best knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised GANs-based method to predict binding affinity."
Pred-binding: large-scale protein-ligand binding affinity prediction.,26888050,"Drug target interactions (DTIs) are crucial in pharmacology and drug discovery. Presently, experimental determination of compound-protein interactions remains challenging because of funding investment and difficulties of purifying proteins. In this study, we proposed two in silico models based on support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), using 1589 molecular descriptors and 1080 protein descriptors in 9948 ligand-protein pairs to predict DTIs that were quantified by Ki values. The cross-validation coefficient of determination of 0.6079 for SVM and 0.6267 for RF were obtained, respectively. In addition, the two-dimensional (2D) autocorrelation, topological charge indices and three-dimensional (3D)-MoRSE descriptors of compounds, the autocorrelation descriptors and the amphiphilic pseudo-amino acid composition of protein are found most important for Ki predictions.

Integrating Biological Networks for Drug Target Prediction and Prioritization.,30547444,"Computational prediction of the clinical success or failure of a potential drug target for therapeutic use is a challenging problem. Novel network propagation algorithms that integrate heterogeneous biological networks are proving useful for drug target identification and prioritization. These approaches typically utilize a network describing relationships between targets, a method to disseminate the relevant information through the network, and a method to elucidate new associations between targets and diseases. Here, we utilize one such network propagation-based approach, DTINet, which starts with diffusion component analysis of networks of both potential drug targets and diseases. Then an inductive matrix completion algorithm is applied to identify novel disease targets based on their network topological similarities with known disease targets with successfully launched drugs. DTINet performed well as assessed with area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR = 0.88 ± 0.007) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC = 0.86 ± 0.008). These metrics improved when we combined data from multiple networks in the target space but reduced significantly when we used a more conservative method to define negative controls (AUPR = 0.56 ± 0.007, AUROC = 0.57 ± 0.007).

Though effective, most of them fall short of considering the topological structure of the DTI network, which provides a global view to discover novel DTIs. In this paper, a network-based computational method, namely LG-DTI, is proposed to accurately predict DTIs over a heterogeneous information network. For drugs and target proteins, LG-DTI first learns not only their local representations from drug molecular structures and protein sequences, but also their global representations by using a semi-supervised heterogeneous network embedding method. These two kinds of representations consist of the final representations of drugs and target proteins, which are then incorporated into a Random Forest classifier to complete the task of DTI prediction.

Having demonstrated the excellent predictive ability of our framework, we utilized the best performing AdaBoost model to predict the logK1 values of lanthanide cations with nearly 71 million compounds present in the PubChem database.

However, protein-ligand binding affinity prediction still has fundamental challenges. One challenge is that the mutual information between proteins and ligands is hard to capture. Another challenge is how to find and highlight the important atoms of the ligands and residues of the proteins. To solve these limitations, we develop a novel graph neural network strategy with the Vina distance optimization terms (GraphscoreDTA) for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity, which takes the combination of graph neural network, bitransport information mechanism and physics-based distance terms into account for the first time. Unlike other methods, GraphscoreDTA can not only effectively capture the protein-ligand pairs' mutual information but also highlight the important atoms of the ligands and residues of the proteins. The results show that GraphscoreDTA significantly outperforms existing methods on multiple test sets. Furthermore, the tests of drug-target selectivity on the cyclin-dependent kinase and the homologous protein families demonstrate that GraphscoreDTA is a reliable tool for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction.

A deep learning method for drug-target affinity prediction based on sequence interaction information mining.,38099302,"A critical aspect of <i>in silico</i> drug discovery involves the prediction of drug-target affinity (DTA). Conducting wet lab experiments to determine affinity is both expensive and time-consuming, making it necessary to find alternative approaches. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a promising technique for DTA prediction, leveraging the substantial computational power of modern computers. We proposed a novel sequence-based approach, named KC-DTA, for predicting drug-target affinity (DTA). In this approach, we converted the target sequence into two distinct matrices, while representing the molecule compound as a graph. The proposed method utilized k-mers analysis and Cartesian product calculation to capture the interactions and evolutionary information among various residues, enabling the creation of the two matrices for target sequence. For molecule, it was represented by constructing a molecular graph where atoms serve as nodes and chemical bonds serve as edges. Subsequently, the obtained target matrices and molecule graph were utilized as inputs for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) to extract hidden features, which were further used for the prediction of binding affinity. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted several experiments and made a comprehensive comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches using multiple evaluation metrics.

MiRNA analysis revealed that the TERThigh-specific miR-17-92 cluster can target biological processes enriched in TERTlow cancer and that its expression is negatively correlated with the tumor/normal telomere length ratio. Intriguingly, TERThigh cancers tend to have mutations in extracellular matrix organization genes and amplify MAPK signaling. By mining the clinical actionable gene database, we uncovered a number of TERThigh-specific somatic mutations, amplifications and high expression genes containing therapeutic targets. Finally, a random forest classifier integrating telomerase-associated multi-omics signatures identifies two cancer subtypes showed profound differences in telomerase activity and patient survival."
GIFDTI: Prediction of Drug-Target Interactions Based on Global Molecular and Intermolecular Interaction Representation Learning.,36445997,"Drug discovery and drug repurposing often rely on the successful prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs).

One challenge in building deep learning-based models is to adequately represent drugs and proteins that encompass the fundamental local chemical environments and long-distance information among amino acids of proteins (or atoms of drugs). Another challenge is to efficiently model the intermolecular interactions between drugs and proteins, which plays vital roles in the DTIs. To this end, we propose a novel model, GIFDTI, which consists of three key components: the sequence feature extractor (CNNFormer), the global molecular feature extractor (GF), and the intermolecular interaction modeling module (IIF). Specifically, CNNFormer incorporates CNN and Transformer to capture the local patterns and encode the long-distance relationship among tokens (atoms or amino acids) in a sequence. Then, GF and IIF extract the global molecular features and the intermolecular interaction features, respectively. We evaluate GIFDTI on six realistic evaluation strategies and the results show it improves DTI prediction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

DTITR: End-to-end drug-target binding affinity prediction with transformers.,35777085,"The accurate identification of Drug-Target Interactions (DTIs) remains a critical turning point in drug discovery and understanding of the binding process. Despite recent advances in computational solutions to overcome the challenges of in vitro and in vivo experiments, most of the proposed in silico-based methods still focus on binary classification, overlooking the importance of characterizing DTIs with unbiased binding strength values to properly distinguish primary interactions from those with off-targets. Moreover, several of these methods usually simplify the entire interaction mechanism, neglecting the joint contribution of the individual units of each binding component and the interacting substructures involved, and have yet to focus on more explainable and interpretable architectures. In this study, we propose an end-to-end Transformer-based architecture for predicting drug-target binding affinity (DTA) using 1D raw sequential and structural data to represent the proteins and compounds. This architecture exploits self-attention layers to capture the biological and chemical context of the proteins and compounds, respectively, and cross-attention layers to exchange information and capture the pharmacological context of the DTIs. The results show that the proposed architecture is effective in predicting DTA, achieving superior performance in both correctly predicting the value of interaction strength and being able to correctly discriminate the rank order of binding strength compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The combination of multiple Transformer-Encoders was found to result in robust and discriminative aggregate representations of the proteins and compounds for binding affinity prediction, in which the addition of a Cross-Attention Transformer-Encoder was identified as an important block for improving the discriminative power of these representations. Overall, this research study validates the applicability of an end-to-end Transformer-based architecture in the context of drug discovery, capable of self-providing different levels of potential DTI and prediction understanding due to the nature of the attention blocks.

Specifically, we employ Normalized Compression Distance and Smith-Waterman measures for capturing complementary information from the algorithmic information theory and biological domains, respectively. We utilize the proposed measure to encode the input proteins feeding a new deep neural network-based method for drug-target binding affinity prediction, named BiComp-DTA. BiComp-DTA is evaluated utilizing four benchmark datasets for drug-target binding affinity prediction. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, which employ complex models for protein encoding and feature extraction, BiComp-DTA provides superior efficiency in terms of accuracy, runtime, and the number of trainable parameters. The latter achievement facilitates execution of BiComp-DTA on a normal desktop computer in a fast fashion. As a comparative study, we evaluate BiComp's efficiency against its components for drug-target binding affinity prediction. The results have shown superior accuracy of BiComp due to the orthogonality and complementary nature of Smith-Waterman and Normalized Compression Distance measures for protein sequences. Such a protein sequence encoding provides efficient representation with no need for multiple sources of information, deep domain knowledge, and complex neural networks."
Modality-DTA: Multimodality Fusion Strategy for Drug-Target Affinity Prediction.,36083952,"Prediction of the drug-target affinity (DTA) plays an important role in drug discovery. Existing deep learning methods for DTA prediction typically leverage a single modality, namely simplified molecular input line entry specification (SMILES) or amino acid sequence to learn representations. SMILES or amino acid sequences can be encoded into different modalities. Multimodality data provide different kinds of information, with complementary roles for DTA prediction. We propose Modality-DTA, a novel deep learning method for DTA prediction that leverages the multimodality of drugs and targets. A group of backward propagation neural networks is applied to ensure the completeness of the reconstruction process from the latent feature representation to original multimodality data. The tag between the drug and target is used to reduce the noise information in the latent representation from multimodality data. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our Modality-DTA outperforms existing methods in all metrics. Modality-DTA reduces the mean square error by 15.7% and improves the area under the precisionrecall curve by 12.74% in the Davis dataset.

FSM-DDTR: End-to-end feedback strategy for multi-objective De Novo drug design using transformers.,37557054,"The design of compounds that target specific biological functions with relevant selectivity is critical in the context of drug discovery, especially due to the polypharmacological nature of most existing drug molecules. In recent years, in silico-based methods combined with deep learning have shown promising results in the de novo drug design challenge, leading to potential leads for biologically interesting targets. However, several of these methods overlook the importance of certain properties, such as validity rate and target selectivity, or simplify the generative process by neglecting the multi-objective nature of the pharmacological space. In this study, we propose a multi-objective Transformer-based architecture to generate drug candidates with desired molecular properties and increased selectivity toward a specific biological target. The framework consists of a Transformer-Decoder Generator that generates novel and valid compounds in the SMILES format notation, a Transformer-Encoder Predictor that estimates the binding affinity toward the biological target, and a feedback loop combined with a multi-objective optimization strategy to rank the generated molecules and condition the generating distribution around the targeted properties. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture can generate novel and synthesizable small compounds with desired pharmacological properties toward a biologically relevant target. The unbiased Transformer-based Generator achieved superior performance in the novelty rate (97.38%) and comparable performance in terms of internal diversity, uniqueness, and validity against state-of-the-art baselines. The optimization of the unbiased Transformer-based Generator resulted in the generation of molecules exhibiting high binding affinity toward the Adenosine A2A Receptor (AA2AR) and possessing desirable physicochemical properties, where 99.36% of the generated molecules follow Lipinski's rule of five. Furthermore, the implementation of a feedback strategy, in conjunction with a multi-objective algorithm, effectively shifted the distribution of the generated molecules toward optimal values of molecular weight, molecular lipophilicity, topological polar surface area, synthetic accessibility score, and quantitative estimate of drug-likeness, without the necessity of prior training sets comprising molecules endowed with pharmacological properties of interest. Overall, this research study validates the applicability of a Transformer-based architecture in the context of drug design, capable of exploring the vast chemical representation space to generate novel molecules with improved pharmacological properties and target selectivity.

Proteolytic cleavage of host proteins by the Group IV viral proteases of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and Zika virus.,30742841,"The alphaviral nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) cysteine proteases (EC 3.4.22.-) are essential for the proteolytic processing of the nonstructural (ns) polyprotein and are validated drug targets. A common secondary role of these proteases is to antagonize the effects of interferon (IFN). After delineating the cleavage site motif of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) nsP2 cysteine protease, we searched the human genome to identify host protein substrates. Here we identify a new host substrate of the VEEV nsP2 protease, human TRIM14, a component of the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) signalosome. Short stretches of homologous host-pathogen protein sequences (SSHHPS) are present in the nonstructural polyprotein and TRIM14. A 25-residue cyan-yellow fluorescent protein TRIM14 substrate was cleaved in vitro by the VEEV nsP2 protease and the cleavage site was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry. A TRIM14 cleavage product also was found in VEEV-infected cell lysates. At least ten other Group IV (+)ssRNA viral proteases have been shown to cleave host proteins involved in generating the innate immune responses against viruses, suggesting that the integration of these short host protein sequences into the viral protease cleavage sites may represent an embedded mechanism of IFN antagonism. This interference mechanism shows several parallels with those of CRISPR/Cas9 and RNAi/RISC, but with a protease recognizing a protein sequence common to both the host and pathogen. The short host sequences embedded within the viral genome appear to be analogous to the short phage sequences found in a host's CRISPR spacer sequences. To test this algorithm, we applied it to another Group IV virus, Zika virus (ZIKV), and identified cleavage sites within human SFRP1 (secreted frizzled related protein 1), a retinal Gs alpha subunit, NT5M, and Forkhead box protein G1 (FOXG1) in vitro. Proteolytic cleavage of these proteins suggests a possible link between the protease and the virus-induced phenotype of ZIKV. The algorithm may have value for selecting cell lines and animal models that recapitulate virus-induced phenotypes, predicting host-range and susceptibility, selecting oncolytic viruses, identifying biomarkers, and de-risking live virus vaccines.

Predicting affinity through homology (PATH): interpretable binding affinity prediction with persistent homology,38014181,"Accurate binding affinity prediction is crucial to structure-based drug design.

In this work, we propose a novel, interpretable algorithm for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. Our algorithm achieves interpretability through an effective embedding of distances across bipartite matchings of the protein and ligand atoms into real-valued functions by summing Gaussians centered at features constructed by persistent homology.
