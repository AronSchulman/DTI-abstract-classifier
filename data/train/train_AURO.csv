Predicting Drug-Target Interactions with Electrotopological State Fingerprints and Amphiphilic Pseudo Amino Acid Composition.,32784497,"The task of drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction plays important roles in drug development. The experimental methods in DTIs are time-consuming, expensive and challenging. To solve these problems, machine learning-based methods are introduced, which are restricted by effective feature
extraction and negative sampling. In this work, features with electrotopological state (E-state) fingerprints for drugs and amphiphilic pseudo amino acid composition (APAAC) for target proteins are tested. E-state fingerprints are extracted based on both molecular electronic and topological features
with the same metric. APAAC is an extension of amino acid composition (AAC), which is calculated based on hydrophilic and hydrophobic characters to construct sequence order information. Using the combination of these feature pairs, the prediction model is established by support vector machines. In
order to enhance the effectiveness of features, a distance-based negative sampling is proposed to obtain reliable negative samples. It is shown that the prediction results of area under curve for Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC) are above 98.5% for all the three datasets in this work. The

A Convolutional Neural Network System to Discriminate Drug-Target Interactions.,31514149,"Biological targets are most commonly proteins such as enzymes, ion channels, and receptors. They are anything within a living organism to bind with some other entities (like an endogenous ligand or a drug), resulting in change in their behaviors or functions. Exploring potential

"Deciphering the pharmacological mechanisms of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi on oral leukoplakia by combining network pharmacology, molecular docking and experimental evaluations.",35667260,"Oral leukoplakia (OLK), an uncharacterized pathological condition that occurs as a white patch in the oral mucosa, is the most common precancerous condition. Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (SBG) is a medicinal plant with a wide range of pharmacological effects. Increased evidence shows
that SBG has potential therapeutic effects on OLK. However, the therapeutic mechanisms of SBG against OLK have not yet been completely elucidated. This study aimed to clarify the active components and multi-target mechanisms of SBG against OLK via network pharmacology, molecular docking and
experimental evaluations. The active components and related targets of SBG were screened by the TCMSP database and Swiss Target Prediction database. Potential therapeutic targets of OLK were collected using the GeneCards and OMIM databases. Then, we established protein-protein interaction (PPI),
compound-target-disease (C-T-D), and compound-target-pathway (C-T-P) networks by Cytoscape to identify the main components, core targets, and pharmacological pathways of SBG against OLK via applying data mining techniques and topological parameters. Metascape database was utilized for GO and KEGG
pathway analysis. Molecular docking techniques were used to estimate the binding force between the components and the hub genes. Subsequently, a series of in vitro experiments, specifically CCK-8 assay, clone formation assay, wound healing assay, flow cytometry, RT-qPCR and western blotting were
conducted for further verification. There were 25 active components and 31 related target genes in SBG against OLK. PPI analysis showed that Akt1, VEGFA, EGFR, HIF1A and PTGS2 shared the highest centrality among all target genes. KEGG pathway analysis found that PI3K-Akt signaling pathway may occupy
core status in the anti-OLK system. Molecular docking results showed that the main active components of SBG had a strong binding affinity to the hub genes. In vitro experiments showed that the leading component baicalein may inhibit proliferation, block cells in the S phase, induce DOK cell
apoptosis, and downregulate the mRNA expression of 5 hub genes by inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway activation. The most predominant component of SBG against OLK was baicalein and the key pathway was PI3K/Akt. The main components and hub genes had robust binding abilities. In vitro experiments

Specific gene module pair-based target identification and drug discovery.,36726786,"Identification of the biological targets of a compound is of paramount importance for the exploration of the mechanism of action of drugs and for the development of novel drugs.

those reference drugs. However, the available methods are often inefficient due to the requirement of the reference drugs as a medium to link the query agent and targets. Here, we developed a general procedure to extract target-induced consensus gene modules from the transcriptional profiles induced
by the treatment of perturbagens of a target. A specific transcriptional gene module pair (GMP) was automatically identified for each target and could be used as a direct target signature. Based on the GMPs, we built the target network and identified some target gene clusters with similar biological

similarity, which combines similarity fusion matrices with Random Walk with Restart (RWR) and cosine similarity. Then, we use GCN to extract multi-layer low-dimensional embedding features. Unlike traditional GCN methods, we incorporate Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL). Finally, we use the Dual Laplace
Regularized Least Squares method to predict novel DTIs through combinatorial kernels in drug and target spaces. We conduct experiments on a golden standard dataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in predicting DTIs through showing significant improvements in Area Under the
Curve (AUC) and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPR). In addition, our model can also discover some new DTIs, which can be verified by the KEGG BRITE Database and relevant literature."

Ligand Binding Prediction Using Protein Structure Graphs and Residual Graph Attention Networks.,36014351,"Computational prediction of ligand-target interactions is a crucial part of modern drug discovery as it helps to bypass high costs and labor demands of in vitro and in vivo screening. As the wealth of bioactivity data accumulates, it provides opportunities for the development of deep
learning (DL) models with increasing predictive powers. Conventionally, such models were either limited to the use of very simplified representations of proteins or ineffective voxelization of their 3D structures. Herein, we present the development of the PSG-BAR (Protein Structure Graph-Binding
Affinity Regression) approach that utilizes 3D structural information of the proteins along with 2D graph representations of ligands. The method also introduces attention scores to selectively weight protein regions that are most important for ligand binding. Results: The developed approach
demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on several binding affinity benchmarking datasets. The attention-based pooling of protein graphs enables identification of surface residues as critical residues for protein-ligand binding. Finally, we validate our model predictions against an

Drug-target interactions prediction using marginalized denoising model on heterogeneous networks.,32703151,"Drugs achieve pharmacological functions by acting on target proteins. Identifying interactions between drugs and target proteins is an essential task in old drug repositioning and new drug discovery.

Identification of drug-target interaction by a random walk with restart method on an interactome network.,29897326,"Identification of drug-target interactions acts as a key role in drug discovery.

Predicting Affinity Through Homology (PATH): Interpretable Binding Affinity Prediction with Persistent Homology.,38014181,"Accurate binding affinity prediction is crucial to structure-based drug design. Recent work used computational topology to obtain an effective representation of protein-ligand interactions.

In this work, we propose a novel, interpretable algorithm for protein-ligand binding affinity
