DT-Web: a web-based application for drug-target interaction and drug combination prediction through domain-tuned network-based inference.,26050742,"Background: The identification of drug-target interactions (DTI) is a costly and time-consuming step in drug discovery and design. Computational methods capable of predicting reliable DTI play an important role in the field. Algorithms may aim to design new therapies based on a single approved drug or a combination of them. Recently, recommendation methods relying on network-based inference in connection with knowledge coming from the specific domain have been proposed. Description: Here we propose a web-based interface to the DT-Hybrid algorithm, which applies a recommendation technique based on bipartite network projection implementing resources transfer within the network. This technique combined with domain-specific knowledge expressing drugs and targets similarity is used to compute recommendations for each drug. Our web interface allows the users: (i) to browse all the predictions inferred by the algorithm; (ii) to upload their custom data on which they wish to obtain a prediction through a DT-Hybrid based pipeline; (iii) to help in the early stages of drug combinations, repositioning, substitution, or resistance studies by finding drugs that can act simultaneously on multiple targets in a multi-pathway environment. Our system is periodically synchronized with DrugBank and updated accordingly. The website is free, open to all users, and available at http://alpha.dmi.unict.it/dtweb/. Conclusions: Our web interface allows users to search and visualize information on drugs and targets eventually providing their own data to compute a list of predictions. The user can visualize information about the characteristics of each drug, a list of predicted and validated targets, associated enzymes and transporters. A table containing key information and GO classification allows the users to perform their own analysis on our data. A special interface for data submission allows the execution of a pipeline, based on DT-Hybrid, predicting new targets with the corresponding p-values expressing the reliability of each group of predictions. Finally, It is also possible to specify a list of genes tracking down all the drugs that may have an indirect influence on them based on a multi-drug, multi-target, multi-pathway analysis, which aims to discover drugs for future follow-up studies.",0,"DT-Web: a web-based application for drug-target interaction and drug combination prediction through domain-tuned network-based inference.

Toxicity prediction using target,37061207,"In silico methods are essential to the safety evaluation of chemicals. Computational risk assessment offers several approaches, with data science and knowledge-based methods becoming an increasingly important sub-group. One of the substantial attributes of data science is that it allows using existing data to find correlations, build strong hypotheses, and create new, valuable knowledge that may help to reduce the number of resource intensive experiments. In choosing a suitable method for toxicity prediction, the available data and desired toxicity endpoint are two essential factors to consider. The complexity of the endpoint can impact the success rate of the in silico models. For highly complex endpoints such as hepatotoxicity, it can be beneficial to decipher the toxic event from a more systemic point of view. We propose a data science-based modelling pipeline that uses compounds` connections to tissue-specific biological targets, interactome, and biological pathways as descriptors of compounds. Models trained on different combinations of the collected, compound-target, compound-interactor, and compound-pathway profiles, were used to predict the hepatotoxicity of drug-like compounds. Several tree-based models were trained, utilizing separate and combined target, interactome and pathway level variables. The model using combined descriptors of all levels and the random forest algorithm was further optimized. Descriptor importance for model performance was addressed and examined for a biological explanation to define which targets or pathways can have a crucial role in toxicity. Descriptors connected to cytochromes P450 enzymes, heme degradation and biological oxidation received high weights. Furthermore, the involvement of other, less discussed processes in connection with toxicity, such as the involvement of RHO GTPase effectors in hepatotoxicity, were marked as fundamental. The optimized combined model using only the selected descriptors yielded the best performance with an accuracy of 0.766. The same dataset using classical Morgan fingerprints for compound representation yielded models with similar performance measures, as well as the combination of systems biology-based descriptors and Morgan fingerprints.

SAMPL6 host-guest binding affinities and binding poses from spherical-coordinates-biased simulations.,31974852,"Host-guest binding is a challenging problem in computer simulation. The prediction of binding affinities between hosts and guests is an important part of the statistical assessment of the modeling of proteins and ligands (SAMPL) challenges.

TranSynergy: Mechanism-driven interpretable deep neural network for the synergistic prediction and pathway deconvolution of drug combinations.,33577560,"Drug combinations have demonstrated great potential in cancer treatments. They alleviate drug resistance and improve therapeutic efficacy. The fast-growing number of anti-cancer drugs has caused the experimental investigation of all drug combinations to become costly and time-consuming. Computational techniques can improve the efficiency of drug combination screening. Despite recent advances in applying machine learning to synergistic drug combination prediction, several challenges remain. First, the performance of existing methods is suboptimal. There is still much space for improvement. Second, biological knowledge has not been fully incorporated into the model. Finally, many models are lack interpretability, limiting their clinical applications. To address these challenges, we have developed a knowledge-enabled and self-attention transformer boosted deep learning model, TranSynergy, which improves the performance and interpretability of synergistic drug combination prediction. TranSynergy is designed so that the cellular effect of drug actions can be explicitly modeled through cell-line gene dependency, gene-gene interaction, and genome-wide drug-target interaction. A novel Shapley Additive Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (SA-GSEA) method has been developed to deconvolute genes that contribute to the synergistic drug combination and improve model interpretability. Extensive benchmark studies demonstrate that TranSynergy outperforms the state-of-the-art method, suggesting the potential of mechanism-driven machine learning. Novel pathways that are associated with the synergistic combinations are revealed and supported by experimental evidences. They may provide new insights into identifying biomarkers for precision medicine and discovering new anti-cancer therapies.

Herein, we present the development of the PSG-BAR (Protein Structure Graph-Binding Affinity Regression) approach that utilizes 3D structural information of the proteins along with 2D graph representations of ligands. The method also introduces attention scores to selectively weight protein regions that are most important for ligand binding. Results: The developed approach demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on several binding affinity benchmarking datasets.

Diversity and evolution of computationally predicted T cell epitopes against human respiratory syncytial virus.,36626370,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory infection. Despite more than 60 years of research, there is no licensed vaccine. While B cell response is a major focus for vaccine design, the T cell epitope profile of RSV is also important for vaccine development. Here, we computationally predicted putative T cell epitopes in the Fusion protein (F) and Glycoprotein (G) of RSV wild circulating strains by predicting Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I and class II binding affinity. We limited our inferences to conserved epitopes in both F and G proteins that have been experimentally validated. We applied multidimensional scaling (MDS) to construct T cell epitope landscapes to investigate the diversity and evolution of T cell profiles across different RSV strains. We find the RSV strains are clustered into three RSV-A groups and two RSV-B groups on this T epitope landscape. These clusters represent divergent RSV strains with potentially different immunogenic profiles. In addition, our results show a greater proportion of F protein T cell epitope content conservation among recent epidemic strains, whereas the G protein T cell epitope content was decreased. Importantly, our results suggest that RSV-A and RSV-B have different patterns of epitope drift and replacement and that RSV-B vaccines may need more frequent updates.

Drug-Target Interaction Prediction Based on Drug Fingerprint Information and Protein Sequence.,31430892,"The identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a critical step in drug development. Experimental methods that are based on clinical trials to discover DTIs are time-consuming, expensive, and challenging.

Inferring Drug-Target Interactions Based on Random Walk and Convolutional Neural Network.,33729947,"Computational strategies for identifying new drug-target interactions (DTIs) can guide the process of drug discovery, reduce the cost and time of drug development, and thus promote drug development.

Drug-target interaction prediction with tree-ensemble learning and output space reconstruction.,32033537,"Computational prediction of drug-target interactions (DTI) is vital for drug discovery. The experimental identification of interactions between drugs and target proteins is very onerous. Modern technologies have mitigated the problem, leveraging the development of new drugs. However, drug development remains extremely expensive and time consuming. Therefore, in silico DTI predictions based on machine learning can alleviate the burdensome task of drug development. Many machine learning approaches have been proposed over the years for DTI prediction. Nevertheless, prediction accuracy and efficiency are persisting problems that still need to be tackled. Here, we propose a new learning method which addresses DTI prediction as a multi-output prediction task by learning ensembles of multi-output bi-clustering trees (eBICT) on reconstructed networks. In our setting, the nodes of a DTI network (drugs and proteins) are represented by features (background information). The interactions between the nodes of a DTI network are modeled as an interaction matrix and compose the output space in our problem. The proposed approach integrates background information from both drug and target protein spaces into the same global network framework. We performed an empirical evaluation, comparing the proposed approach to state of the art DTI prediction methods and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in different prediction settings. For evaluation purposes, we used several benchmark datasets that represent drug-protein networks.

Computational prediction of drug-target interactions (DTI) is vital for drug discovery. The experimental identification of interactions between drugs and target proteins is very onerous. Modern technologies have mitigated the problem, leveraging the development of new drugs. However, drug development remains extremely expensive and time consuming. Therefore, in silico DTI predictions based on machine learning can alleviate the burdensome task of drug development. Many machine learning approaches have been proposed over the years for DTI prediction. Nevertheless, prediction accuracy and efficiency are persisting problems that still need to be tackled. Here, we propose a new learning method which addresses DTI prediction as a multi-output prediction task by learning ensembles of multi-output bi-clustering trees (eBICT) on reconstructed networks. In our setting, the nodes of a DTI network (drugs and proteins) are represented by features (background information). The interactions between the nodes of a DTI network are modeled as an interaction matrix and compose the output space in our problem. The proposed approach integrates background information from both drug and target protein spaces into the same global network framework. We performed an empirical evaluation, comparing the proposed approach to state of the art DTI prediction methods and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in different prediction settings. For evaluation purposes, we used several benchmark datasets that represent drug-protein networks. We show that output space reconstruction can boost the predictive performance of tree-ensemble learning methods, yielding more accurate DTI predictions.

Drug-Target Interaction Prediction Based on Multisource Information Weighted Fusion.,34908912,"Recently, in most existing studies, it is assumed that there are no interaction relationships between drugs and targets with unknown interactions.

Improving the Accuracy of Protein Thermostability Predictions for Single Point Mutations.,32533939,"Accurately predicting the protein thermostability changes upon single point mutations in silico is a challenge that has implications for understanding diseases as well as industrial applications of protein engineering. Free energy perturbation (FEP) has been applied to predict the effect of single point mutations on protein stability for over 40 years and emerged as a potentially reliable prediction method with reasonable throughput. However, applications of FEP in protein stability calculations in industrial settings have been hindered by a number of limitations, including the inability to model mutations to and from prolines in which the bonded topology of the backbone is modified and the complexity in modeling charge-changing mutations. In this study, we have extended the FEP+ protocol to enable the accurate modeling of the effects on protein stability from proline mutations and from charge-changing mutations. We also evaluated the influence of the unfolded model in the stability calculations using increasingly longer peptides with native sequence and conformations.

Accurately predicting the protein thermostability changes upon single point mutations in silico is a challenge that has implications for understanding diseases as well as industrial applications of protein engineering. Free energy perturbation (FEP) has been applied to predict the effect of single point mutations on protein stability for over 40 years and emerged as a potentially reliable prediction method with reasonable throughput. However, applications of FEP in protein stability calculations in industrial settings have been hindered by a number of limitations, including the inability to model mutations to and from prolines in which the bonded topology of the backbone is modified and the complexity in modeling charge-changing mutations. In this study, we have extended the FEP+ protocol to enable the accurate modeling of the effects on protein stability from proline mutations and from charge-changing mutations.

Adaptive one-class Gaussian processes allow accurate prioritization of oncology drug targets.,33165571,"Motivation: The cost of drug development has dramatically increased in the last decades, with the number new drugs approved per billion US dollars spent on R&D halving every year or less. The selection and prioritization of targets is one the most influential decisions in drug discovery. Here we present a Gaussian Process model for the prioritization of drug targets cast as a problem of learning with only positive and unlabeled examples. Results: Since the absence of negative samples does not allow standard methods for automatic selection of hyperparameters, we propose a novel approach for hyperparameter selection of the kernel in One Class Gaussian Processes. We compare our methods with state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets and then show its application to druggability prediction of oncology drugs. Our score reaches an AUC 0.90 on a set of clinical trial targets starting from a small training set of 102 validated oncology targets.

Novel drug-target interactions via link prediction and network embedding.,35379165,"As many interactions between the chemical and genomic space remain undiscovered, computational methods able to identify potential drug-target interactions (DTIs) are employed to accelerate drug discovery and reduce the required cost. Predicting new DTIs can leverage drug repurposing by identifying new targets for approved drugs. However, developing an accurate computational framework that can efficiently incorporate chemical and genomic spaces remains extremely demanding. A key issue is that most DTI predictions suffer from the lack of experimentally validated negative interactions or limited availability of target 3D structures. We report DT2Vec, a pipeline for DTI prediction based on graph embedding and gradient boosted tree classification. It maps drug-drug and protein-protein similarity networks to low-dimensional features and the DTI prediction is formulated as binary classification based on a strategy of concatenating the drug and target embedding vectors as input features. DT2Vec was compared with three top-performing graph similarity-based algorithms on a standard benchmark dataset and achieved competitive results.

As many interactions between the chemical and genomic space remain undiscovered, computational methods able to identify potential drug-target interactions (DTIs) are employed to accelerate drug discovery and reduce the required cost. Predicting new DTIs can leverage drug repurposing by identifying new targets for approved drugs. However, developing an accurate computational framework that can efficiently incorporate chemical and genomic spaces remains extremely demanding. A key issue is that most DTI predictions suffer from the lack of experimentally validated negative interactions or limited availability of target 3D structures. We report DT2Vec, a pipeline for DTI prediction based on graph embedding and gradient boosted tree classification. It maps drug-drug and protein-protein similarity networks to low-dimensional features and the DTI prediction is formulated as binary classification based on a strategy of concatenating the drug and target embedding vectors as input features. DT2Vec was compared with three top-performing graph similarity-based algorithms on a standard benchmark dataset and achieved competitive results.

Prediction of drug-target binding affinity using similarity-based convolutional neural network.,33627791,"Identifying novel drug-target interactions (DTIs) plays an important role in drug discovery. Most of the computational methods developed for predicting DTIs use binary classification, whose goal is to determine whether or not a drug-target (DT) pair interacts.

If the binding affinity is not sufficiently large, such drug may not be useful. Therefore, the methods for predicting DT binding affinities are very valuable. The increase in novel public affinity data available in the DT-related databases enables advanced deep learning techniques to be used to predict binding affinities.

Can Relative Binding Free Energy Predict Selectivity of Reversible Covalent Inhibitors?,29124934,"Reversible covalent inhibitors have many clinical advantages over noncovalent or irreversible covalent drugs. However, apart from selecting a warhead, substantial efforts in design and synthesis are needed to optimize noncovalent interactions to improve target-selective binding. Computational prediction of binding affinity for reversible covalent inhibitors presents a unique challenge since the binding process consists of multiple steps, which are not necessarily independent of each other. In this study, we lay out the relation between relative binding free energy and the overall reversible covalent binding affinity using a two-state binding model. To prove the concept, we employed free energy perturbation (FEP) coupled with λ-exchange molecular dynamics method to calculate the binding free energy of a series of α-ketoamide analogues relative to a common warhead scaffold, in both noncovalent and covalent binding states, and for two highly homologous proteases, calpain-1 and calpain-2. We conclude that covalent binding state alone, in general, can be used to predict reversible covalent binding selectivity. However, exceptions may exist. Therefore, we also discuss the conditions under which the noncovalent binding step is no longer negligible and propose to combine the relative FEP calculations with a single QM/MM calculation of warhead to predict the binding affinity and binding kinetics. Our FEP calculations also revealed that covalent and noncovalent binding states of an inhibitor do not necessarily exhibit the same selectivity. Thus, investigating both binding states, as well as the kinetics will provide extremely useful information for optimizing reversible covalent inhibitors.",0,"Can Relative Binding Free Energy Predict Selectivity of Reversible Covalent Inhibitors?

A novel inhibitor of Plasmodium falciparum spermidine synthase: a twist in the tail.,25651815,"Background: Plasmodium falciparum is the most pathogenic of the human malaria parasite species and a major cause of death in Africa. It's resistance to most of the current drugs accentuates the pressing need for new chemotherapies. Polyamine metabolism of the parasite is distinct from the human pathway making it an attractive target for chemotherapeutic development. Plasmodium falciparum spermidine synthase (PfSpdS) catalyzes the synthesis of spermidine and spermine. It is a major polyamine flux-determining enzyme and spermidine is a prerequisite for the post-translational activation of P. falciparum eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (elF5A). The most potent inhibitors of eukaryotic SpdS's are not specific for PfSpdS. Methods: 'Dynamic' receptor-based pharmacophore models were generated from published crystal structures of SpdS with different ligands. This approach takes into account the inherent flexibility of the active site, which reduces the entropic penalties associated with ligand binding. Four dynamic pharmacophore models were developed and two inhibitors, (1R,4R)-(N1-(3-aminopropyl)-trans-cyclohexane-1,4-diamine (compound 8) and an analogue, N-(3-aminopropyl)-cyclohexylamine (compound 9), were identified. Results: A crystal structure containing compound 8 was solved and confirmed the in silico prediction that its aminopropyl chain traverses the catalytic centre in the presence of the byproduct of catalysis, 5'-methylthioadenosine. The IC50 value of compound 9 is in the same range as that of the most potent inhibitors of PfSpdS, S-adenosyl-1,8-diamino-3-thio-octane (AdoDATO) and 4MCHA and 100-fold lower than that of compound 8. Compound 9 was originally identified as a mammalian spermine synthase inhibitor and does not inhibit mammalian SpdS. This implied that these two compounds bind in an orientation where their aminopropyl chains face the putrescine binding site in the presence of the substrate, decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine. The higher binding affinity and lower receptor strain energy of compound 9 compared to compound 8 in the reversed orientation explained their different IC50 values. Conclusion: The specific inhibition of PfSpdS by compound 9 is enabled by its binding in the additional cavity normally occupied by spermidine when spermine is synthesized. This is the first time that a spermine synthase inhibitor is shown to inhibit PfSpdS, which provides new avenues to explore for the development of novel inhibitors of PfSpdS.",0,"A novel inhibitor of Plasmodium falciparum spermidine synthase: a twist in the tail.

Deep graph embedding for prioritizing synergistic anticancer drug combinations.,32153729,"Drug combinations are frequently used for the treatment of cancer patients in order to increase efficacy, decrease adverse side effects, or overcome drug resistance. Given the enormous number of drug combinations, it is cost- and time-consuming to screen all possible drug pairs experimentally. Currently, it has not been fully explored to integrate multiple networks to predict synergistic drug combinations using recently developed deep learning technologies. In this study, we proposed a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model to predict synergistic drug combinations in particular cancer cell lines. Specifically, the GCN method used a convolutional neural network model to do heterogeneous graph embedding, and thus solved a link prediction task. The graph in this study was a multimodal graph, which was constructed by integrating the drug-drug combination, drug-protein interaction, and protein-protein interaction networks. We found that the GCN model was able to correctly predict cell line-specific synergistic drug combinations from a large heterogonous network. The majority (30) of the 39 cell line-specific models show an area under the receiver operational characteristic curve (AUC) larger than 0.80, resulting in a mean AUC of 0.84. Moreover, we conducted an in-depth literature survey to investigate the top predicted drug combinations in specific cancer cell lines and found that many of them have been found to show synergistic antitumor activity against the same or other cancers in vitro or in vivo. Taken together, the results indicate that our study provides a promising way to better predict and optimize synergistic drug pairs in silico.",0,"Deep graph embedding for prioritizing synergistic anticancer drug combinations.

Prediction of drug-target interactions through multi-task learning.,36316405,"Identifying the binding between the target proteins and molecules is essential in drug discovery. The multi-task learning method has been introduced to facilitate knowledge sharing among tasks when the amount of information for each task is small. However, multi-task learning sometimes worsens the overall performance or generates a trade-off between individual task's performance. In this study, we propose a general multi-task learning scheme that not only increases the average performance but also minimizes individual performance degradation, through group selection and knowledge distillation. The groups are selected on the basis of chemical similarity between ligand sets of targets, and the similar targets in the same groups are trained together. During training, we apply knowledge distillation with teacher annealing. The multi-task learning models are guided by the predictions of the single-task learning models. This method results in higher average performance than that from single-task learning and classic multi-task learning.

Fine-grained selective similarity integration for drug-target interaction prediction.,36907663,"The discovery of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a pivotal process in pharmaceutical development. Computational approaches are a promising and efficient alternative to tedious and costly wet-lab experiments for predicting novel DTIs from numerous candidates. Recently, with the availability of abundant heterogeneous biological information from diverse data sources, computational methods have been able to leverage multiple drug and target similarities to boost the performance of DTI prediction. Similarity integration is an effective and flexible strategy to extract crucial information across complementary similarity views, providing a compressed input for any similarity-based DTI prediction model. However, existing similarity integration methods filter and fuse similarities from a global perspective, neglecting the utility of similarity views for each drug and target. In this study, we propose a Fine-Grained Selective similarity integration approach, called FGS, which employs a local interaction consistency-based weight matrix to capture and exploit the importance of similarities at a finer granularity in both similarity selection and combination steps.

The discovery of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a pivotal process in pharmaceutical development. Computational approaches are a promising and efficient alternative to tedious and costly wet-lab experiments for predicting novel DTIs from numerous candidates. Recently, with the availability of abundant heterogeneous biological information from diverse data sources, computational methods have been able to leverage multiple drug and target similarities to boost the performance of DTI prediction. Similarity integration is an effective and flexible strategy to extract crucial information across complementary similarity views, providing a compressed input for any similarity-based DTI prediction model. However, existing similarity integration methods filter and fuse similarities from a global perspective, neglecting the utility of similarity views for each drug and target. In this study, we propose a Fine-Grained Selective similarity integration approach, called FGS, which employs a local interaction consistency-based weight matrix to capture and exploit the importance of similarities at a finer granularity in both similarity selection and combination steps. We evaluate FGS on five DTI prediction datasets under various prediction settings. Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms similarity integration competitors with comparable computational costs, but also achieves better prediction performance than state-of-the-art DTI prediction approaches by collaborating with conventional base models.

Qualitative Prediction of Ligand Dissociation Kinetics from Focal Adhesion Kinase Using Steered Molecular Dynamics.,33498237,"Most early-stage drug discovery projects focus on equilibrium binding affinity to the target alongside selectivity and other pharmaceutical properties. Since many approved drugs have nonequilibrium binding characteristics, there has been increasing interest in optimizing binding kinetics early in the drug discovery process. As focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is an important drug target, we examine whether steered molecular dynamics (SMD) can be useful for identifying drug candidates with the desired drug-binding kinetics. In simulating the dissociation of 14 ligands from FAK, we find an empirical power-law relationship between the simulated time needed for ligand unbinding and the experimental rate constant for dissociation, with a strong correlation depending on the SMD force used. To improve predictions, we further develop regression models connecting experimental dissociation rate with various structural and energetic quantities derived from the simulations.

Role of Electrostatics in Protein-RNA Binding: The Global vs the Local Energy Landscape.,28806086,"U1A protein-stem loop 2 RNA association is a basic step in the assembly of the spliceosomal U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein. Long-range electrostatic interactions due to the positive charge of U1A are thought to provide high binding affinity for the negatively charged RNA. Short range interactions, such as hydrogen bonds and contacts between RNA bases and protein side chains, favor a specific binding site. Here, we propose that electrostatic interactions are as important as local contacts in biasing the protein-RNA energy landscape toward a specific binding site. We show by using molecular dynamics simulations that deletion of two long-range electrostatic interactions (K22Q and K50Q) leads to mutant-specific alternative RNA bound states. One of these states preserves short-range interactions with aromatic residues in the original binding site, while the other one does not. We test the computational prediction with experimental temperature-jump kinetics using a tryptophan probe in the U1A-RNA binding site. The two mutants show the distinct predicted kinetic behaviors. Thus, the stem loop 2 RNA has multiple binding sites on a rough RNA-protein binding landscape.

However, these models represent the drugs as strings, which is not a natural way to represent molecules. We propose a new model called GraphDTA that represents drugs as graphs and uses graph neural networks to predict drug-target affinity. We show that graph neural networks not only predict drug-target affinity better than non-deep learning models, but also outperform competing deep learning methods. Our results confirm that deep learning models are appropriate for drug-target binding affinity prediction, and that representing drugs as graphs can lead to further improvements. The proposed models are implemented in Python. Related data, pre-trained models and source code are publicly available at https://github.com/thinng/GraphDTA. All scripts and data needed to reproduce the post hoc statistical analysis are available from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3603523. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
Graph-sequence attention and transformer for predicting drug-target affinity.,36320763,"Drug-target binding affinity (DTA) prediction has drawn increasing interest due to its substantial position in the drug discovery process. The development of new drugs is costly, time-consuming, and often accompanied by safety issues. Drug repurposing can avoid the expensive and lengthy process of drug development by finding new uses for already approved drugs. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop effective computational methods to predict DTAs. The attention mechanisms allow the computational method to focus on the most relevant parts of the input and have been proven to be useful for various tasks. In this study, we proposed a novel model based on self-attention, called GSATDTA, to predict the binding affinity between drugs and targets. For the representation of drugs, we use Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRU) to extract the SMILES representation from SMILES sequences, and graph neural networks to extract the graph representation of the molecular graphs. Then we utilize an attention mechanism to fuse the two representations of the drug. For the target/protein, we utilized an efficient transformer to learn the representation of the protein, which can capture the long-distance relationships in the sequence of amino acids. We conduct extensive experiments to compare our model with state-of-the-art models.

Drug-Target Interaction Prediction via Dual Laplacian Graph Regularized Matrix Completion.,30627536,"Drug-target interactions play an important role for biomedical drug discovery and development. However, it is expensive and time-consuming to accomplish this task by experimental determination. Therefore, developing computational techniques for drug-target interaction prediction is urgent and has practical significance. In this work, we propose an effective computational model of dual Laplacian graph regularized matrix completion, referred to as DLGRMC briefly, to infer the unknown drug-target interactions. Specifically, DLGRMC transforms the task of drug-target interaction prediction into a matrix completion problem, in which the potential interactions between drugs and targets can be obtained based on the prediction scores after the matrix completion procedure. In DLGRMC, the drug pairwise chemical structure similarities and the target pairwise genomic sequence similarities are fully exploited to serve the matrix completion by using a dual Laplacian graph regularization term; i.e., drugs with similar chemical structure are more likely to have interactions with similar targets and targets with similar genomic sequence similarity are more likely to have interactions with similar drugs. In addition, during the matrix completion process, an indicator matrix with binary values which indicates the indices of the observed drug-target interactions is deployed to preserve the experimental confirmed interactions. Furthermore, we develop an alternative iterative strategy to solve the constrained matrix completion problem based on Augmented Lagrange Multiplier algorithm. We evaluate DLGRMC on five benchmark datasets and the results show that DLGRMC outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in terms of 10-fold cross validation based AUPR values and PR curves. In addition, case studies also demonstrate that DLGRMC can successfully predict most of the experimental validated drug-target interactions.",1,"Drug-Target Interaction Prediction via Dual Laplacian Graph Regularized Matrix Completion.

Persistent Cohomology for Data With Multicomponent Heterogeneous Information.,34222831,"Persistent homology is a powerful tool for characterizing the topology of a data set at various geometric scales. When applied to the description of molecular structures, persistent homology can capture the multiscale geometric features and reveal certain interaction patterns in terms of topological invariants. However, in addition to the geometric information, there is a wide variety of nongeometric information of molecular structures, such as element types, atomic partial charges, atomic pairwise interactions, and electrostatic potential functions, that is not described by persistent homology. Although element-specific homology and electrostatic persistent homology can encode some nongeometric information into geometry based topological invariants, it is desirable to have a mathematical paradigm to systematically embed both geometric and nongeometric information, i.e., multicomponent heterogeneous information, into unified topological representations. To this end, we propose a persistent cohomology based framework for the enriched representation of data. In our framework, nongeometric information can either be distributed globally or reside locally on the datasets in the geometric sense and can be properly defined on topological spaces, i.e., simplicial complexes.

We consider a variety of datasets to validate the present formulation and illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method based on persistent cohomology.

The Oncogenic and Diagnostic Potential of Stanniocalcin 2 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,35300206,"Purpose: Early detection and prognostic prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain a great challenge. In this study, we explored the role and diagnostic significance of stanniocalcin 2 (STC2), recently identified as a secretory protein, in HCC. Methods: STC2 mRNA and protein in HCC tissues were examined by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The regulatory role of HCC growth by STC2 was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Serum STC2 levels were determined in HCC patients and compared to those with liver cirrhosis (LC) and normal controls (NC). The difference and significance of STC2 levels between groups were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U-test. The diagnostic value of serum STC2 in detecting early HCC was assayed with receiver operating characteristics (ROC). The association of STC2 with overall survival (OS) was determined with Kaplan-Meier method. Results: STC2 was elevated in about 77.1% HCC patients and correlated with advanced tumor progression. Overexpression or knockdown of STC2 stimulated or suppressed HCC colony formation and xenograft tumor growth. AKT activation played a critical role in tumor-promoting effect of STC2. The median level of serum STC2 in HCC patients (n = 98, 2086.6 ng/L) was 2.6-fold and 4.2-fold that in LC patients (n = 42, 801.9 ng/L) and NC (n = 26, 496.9 ng/L), respectively. A cut-off value 1493 ng/L for STC2 could distinguish early HCC from LC with a sensitivity of 76.9% and a specificity of 76.2%, both of which were superior to AFP at 20 μg/L (sensitivity 69.2%, specificity 52.4%). STC2 was positive in 77.8% (14/18) AFP-negative patients. High STC2 level was correlated with poor overall and disease specific survival. Conclusion: STC2 is upregulated in both tumor and serum of HCC patients, and its overexpression promotes HCC via AKT pathway.

Finally, the model was applied to propose potential approved drugs to target cancer-specific biomarkers. DT2Vec+ showed promising results in predicting type of DTI, which was achieved via integrating and mapping triplet drug-target-disease association graphs into low-dimensional dense vectors. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that addresses prediction between drugs and targets across six interaction types."

Optimization of drug-target affinity prediction methods through feature processing schemes.,37812388,"Numerous high-accuracy drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction models, whose performance is heavily reliant on the drug and target feature information, are developed at the expense of complexity and interpretability.

Many existing studies aim to comprehensively characterize drugs and targets by extracting features from multiple perspectives; however, this approach has drawbacks: (i) an abundance of redundant or noisy features; and (ii) the feature sets often suffer from high dimensionality. In this study, to obtain a model with high accuracy and strong interpretability, we utilize various traditional and cutting-edge feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques to process self-associated features and adjacent associated features.

Extensive experimental results on two commonly used datasets indicate that, among various feature optimization methods, the regression tree-based feature selection method is most beneficial for constructing models with good performance and strong robustness.

Towards automated binding affinity prediction using an iterative linear interaction energy approach.,24413750,"Binding affinity prediction of potential drugs to target and off-target proteins is an essential asset in drug development. These predictions require the calculation of binding free energies. In such calculations, it is a major challenge to properly account for both the dynamic nature of the protein and the possible variety of ligand-binding orientations, while keeping computational costs tractable.

"Novel, provable algorithms for efficient ensemble-based computational protein design and their application to the redesign of the c-Raf-RBD:KRas protein-protein interface.",32511232,"The K* algorithm provably approximates partition functions for a set of states (e.g., protein, ligand, and protein-ligand complex) to a user-specified accuracy ε. Often, reaching an ε-approximation for a particular set of partition functions takes a prohibitive amount of time and space. To alleviate some of this cost, we introduce two new algorithms into the osprey suite for protein design: fries, a Fast Removal of Inadequately Energied Sequences, and EWAK*, an Energy Window Approximation to K*. fries pre-processes the sequence space to limit a design to only the most stable, energetically favorable sequence possibilities. EWAK* then takes this pruned sequence space as input and, using a user-specified energy window, calculates K* scores using the lowest energy conformations. We expect fries/EWAK* to be most useful in cases where there are many unstable sequences in the design sequence space and when users are satisfied with enumerating the low-energy ensemble of conformations. In combination, these algorithms provably retain calculational accuracy while limiting the input sequence space and the conformations included in each partition function calculation to only the most energetically favorable, effectively reducing runtime while still enriching for desirable sequences. This combined approach led to significant speed-ups compared to the previous state-of-the-art multi-sequence algorithm, BBK*, while maintaining its efficiency and accuracy, which we show across 40 different protein systems and a total of 2,826 protein design problems. Additionally, as a proof of concept, we used these new algorithms to redesign the protein-protein interface (PPI) of the c-Raf-RBD:KRas complex. The Ras-binding domain of the protein kinase c-Raf (c-Raf-RBD) is the tightest known binder of KRas, a protein implicated in difficult-to-treat cancers. fries/EWAK* accurately retrospectively predicted the effect of 41 different sets of mutations in the PPI of the c-Raf-RBD:KRas complex. Notably, these mutations include mutations whose effect had previously been incorrectly predicted using other computational methods. Next, we used fries/EWAK* for prospective design and discovered a novel point mutation that improves binding of c-Raf-RBD to KRas in its active, GTP-bound state (KRasGTP). We combined this new mutation with two previously reported mutations (which were highly-ranked by osprey) to create a new variant of c-Raf-RBD, c-Raf-RBD(RKY). fries/EWAK* in osprey computationally predicted that this new variant binds even more tightly than the previous best-binding variant, c-Raf-RBD(RK). We measured the binding affinity of c-Raf-RBD(RKY) using a bio-layer interferometry (BLI) assay, and found that this new variant exhibits single-digit nanomolar affinity for KRasGTP, confirming the computational predictions made with fries/EWAK*. This new variant binds roughly five times more tightly than the previous best known binder and roughly 36 times more tightly than the design starting point (wild-type c-Raf-RBD).

We expect fries/EWAK* to be most useful in cases where there are many unstable sequences in the design sequence space and when users are satisfied with enumerating the low-energy ensemble of conformations. In combination, these algorithms provably retain calculational accuracy while limiting the input sequence space and the conformations included in each partition function calculation to only the most energetically favorable, effectively reducing runtime while still enriching for desirable sequences. This combined approach led to significant speed-ups compared to the previous state-of-the-art multi-sequence algorithm, BBK*, while maintaining its efficiency and accuracy, which we show across 40 different protein systems and a total of 2,826 protein design problems. Additionally, as a proof of concept, we used these new algorithms to redesign the protein-protein interface (PPI) of the c-Raf-RBD:KRas complex. The Ras-binding domain of the protein kinase c-Raf (c-Raf-RBD) is the tightest known binder of KRas, a protein implicated in difficult-to-treat cancers. fries/EWAK* accurately retrospectively predicted the effect of 41 different sets of mutations in the PPI of the c-Raf-RBD:KRas complex. Notably, these mutations include mutations whose effect had previously been incorrectly predicted using other computational methods. Next, we used fries/EWAK* for prospective design and discovered a novel point mutation that improves binding of c-Raf-RBD to KRas in its active, GTP-bound state (KRasGTP). We combined this new mutation with two previously reported mutations (which were highly-ranked by osprey) to create a new variant of c-Raf-RBD, c-Raf-RBD(RKY). fries/EWAK* in osprey computationally predicted that this new variant binds even more tightly than the previous best-binding variant, c-Raf-RBD(RK). We measured the binding affinity of c-Raf-RBD(RKY) using a bio-layer interferometry (BLI) assay, and found that this new variant exhibits single-digit nanomolar affinity for KRasGTP, confirming the computational predictions made with fries/EWAK*. This new variant binds roughly five times more tightly than the previous best known binder and roughly 36 times more tightly than the design starting point (wild-type c-Raf-RBD). This study steps through the advancement and development of computational protein design by presenting theory, new algorithms, accurate retrospective designs, new prospective designs, and biochemical validation."
A population response analysis approach to assign class II HLA-epitope restrictions.,25948811,"Identification of the specific HLA locus and allele presenting an epitope for recognition by specific TCRs (HLA restriction) is necessary to fully characterize the immune response to Ags. Experimental determination of HLA restriction is complex and technically challenging. As an alternative, the restricting HLA locus and allele can be inferred by genetic association, using response data in an HLA-typed population. However, simple odds ratio (OR) calculations can be problematic when dealing with large numbers of subjects and Ags, and because the same epitope can be presented by multiple alleles (epitope promiscuity). In this study, we develop a tool, denominated Restrictor Analysis Tool for Epitopes, to extract inferred restriction from HLA class II-typed epitope responses. This automated method infers HLA class II restriction from large datasets of T cell responses in HLA class II-typed subjects by calculating ORs and relative frequencies from simple data tables. The program is validated by: 1) analyzing data of previously determined HLA restrictions; 2) experimentally determining in selected individuals new HLA restrictions using HLA-transfected cell lines; and 3) predicting HLA restriction of particular peptides and showing that corresponding HLA class II tetramers efficiently bind to epitope-specific T cells. We further design a specific iterative algorithm to account for promiscuous recognition by calculation of OR values for combinations of different HLA molecules while incorporating predicted HLA binding affinity.

BindingSite-AugmentedDTA: enabling a next-generation pipeline for interpretable prediction models in drug repurposing.,37096593,"While research into drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is fairly mature, generalizability and interpretability are not always addressed in the existing works in this field. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based framework, called BindingSite-AugmentedDTA, which improves drug-target affinity (DTA) predictions by reducing the search space of potential-binding sites of the protein, thus making the binding affinity prediction more efficient and accurate. Our BindingSite-AugmentedDTA is highly generalizable as it can be integrated with any DL-based regression model, while it significantly improves their prediction performance. Also, unlike many existing models, our model is highly interpretable due to its architecture and self-attention mechanism, which can provide a deeper understanding of its underlying prediction mechanism by mapping attention weights back to protein-binding sites. The computational results confirm that our framework can enhance the prediction performance of seven state-of-the-art DTA prediction algorithms in terms of four widely used evaluation metrics, including concordance index, mean squared error, modified squared correlation coefficient ($r^2_m$) and the area under the precision curve.

In silico prediction and a systematic toxicology-based in vivo investigation uncovering the mechanism of aquatic toxicity caused by beta-lactam antibiotics.,38065262,"Recently, beta-lactam antibiotics have gained attention as significant contributors to public health and environmental issues due to their potential toxicity. Our study employed machine learning to develop a model for assessing the aquatic toxicity of beta-lactam antibiotics on zebrafish. Notably, aztreonam (AZT), a synthetic monobactam and a subclass of beta-lactam antibiotics, demonstrated developmental effects in zebrafish embryos comparable to cephalosporins, indicating a potential for toxicity. Using a systems toxicology-based approach, we identified apoptosis and metabolic disorders as the primary pathways affected by AZT and its impurity F exposure. During the administration of monobactams, we noted that ctsbb, nos2a, and dgat2, genes associated with apoptosis and the metabolic pathway, exhibited significant differential expression. Molecular docking studies were conducted to ascertain the binding affinity between monobactam compounds and their potential targets-Ctsbb, Nos2a, and Dgat2. Furthermore, our research revealed that monobactams influence pre-mRNA alternative splicing, resulting in disruptions in the expression of genes involved in hair cells, brain, spinal cord, and fin regeneration (e.g., krt4, krt5, krt17, cyt1).

To address this, a network-based bioinformatics methodology was used to investigate the potential side effects of known Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antihypertensive drugs, Sartans. This involved identifying the human proteins targeted by these drugs, their first neighbors, and any drugs that bind to them using publicly available experimentally supported data, and subsequently constructing proteomes and protein-drug interactomes.

Using BERT to identify drug-target interactions from whole PubMed.,35729494,"Drug-target interactions (DTIs) are critical for drug repurposing and elucidation of drug mechanisms, and are manually curated by large databases, such as ChEMBL, BindingDB, DrugBank and DrugTargetCommons. However, the number of curated articles likely constitutes only a fraction of all the articles that contain experimentally determined DTIs. Finding such articles and extracting the experimental information is a challenging task, and there is a pressing need for systematic approaches to assist the curation of DTIs. To this end, we applied Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to identify such articles. Because DTI data intimately depends on the type of assays used to generate it, we also aimed to incorporate functions to predict the assay format. Our novel method identified 0.6 million articles (along with drug and protein information) which are not previously included in public DTI databases. Using 10-fold cross-validation, we obtained ~ 99% accuracy for identifying articles containing quantitative drug-target profiles. The F1 micro for the prediction of assay format is 88%, which leaves room for improvement in future studies. The BERT model in this study is robust and the proposed pipeline can be used to identify previously overlooked articles containing quantitative DTIs.

Drug-Target Interaction Prediction Using Multi-Head Self-Attention and Graph Attention Network.,33956632,"Identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) is an important step in the process of new drug discovery and drug repositioning. Accurate predictions for DTIs can improve the efficiency in the drug discovery and development. Although rapid advances in deep learning technologies have generated various computational methods, it is still appealing to further investigate how to design efficient networks for predicting DTIs. In this study, we propose an end-to-end deep learning method (called MHSADTI) to predict DTIs based on the graph attention network and multi-head self-attention mechanism. First, the characteristics of drugs and proteins are extracted by the graph attention network and multi-head self-attention mechanism, respectively. Then, the attention scores are used to consider which amino acid subsequence in a protein is more important for the drug to predict its interactions. Finally, we predict DTIs by a fully connected layer after obtaining the feature vectors of drugs and proteins. MHSADTI takes advantage of self-attention mechanism for obtaining long-dependent contextual relationship in amino acid sequences and predicting DTI interpretability. More effective molecular characteristics are also obtained by the attention mechanism in graph attention networks.

Trans-Ethnic Fine-Mapping of the Major Histocompatibility Complex Region Linked to Parkinson's Disease.,33973677,"Background: Despite evidence for the role of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in the genetic predisposition to Parkinson's disease (PD), the complex haplotype structure and highly polymorphic feature of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region has hampered a unified insight on the genetic risk of PD. In addition, a majority of the reports focused on Europeans, lacking evidence on other populations. Objectives: The aim of this study is to elucidate the genetic features of the MHC region associated with PD risk in trans-ethnic cohorts.Methods: We conducted trans-ethnic fine-mapping of the MHC region for European populations (14,650 cases and 1,288,625 controls) and East Asian populations (7712 cases and 27,372 controls). We adopted a hybrid fine-mapping approach including both HLA genotype imputation of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data and direct imputation of HLA variant risk from the GWAS summary statistics. Results: Through trans-ethnic MHC fine-mapping, we identified the strongest associations at amino acid position 13 of HLA-DRβ1 (P = 6.0 × 10-15 ), which explains the majority of the risk in HLA-DRB1. In silico prediction revealed that HLA-DRB1 alleles with histidine at amino acid position 13 (His13) had significantly weaker binding affinity to an α-synuclein epitope than other alleles (P = 9.6 × 10-4 ). Stepwise conditional analysis suggested additional independent associations at Ala69 in HLA-B (P = 1.0 × 10-7 ). A subanalysis in Europeans suggested additional independent associations at non-HLA genes in the class III MHC region (EHMT2; P = 2.5 × 10-7 ).

DTI-SNNFRA: Drug-target interaction prediction by shared nearest neighbors and fuzzy-rough approximation.,33606741,"In-silico prediction of repurposable drugs is an effective drug discovery strategy that supplements de-nevo drug discovery from scratch.

Here, we have proposed DTI-SNNFRA, a framework for predicting drug-target interaction (DTI), based on shared nearest neighbour (SNN) and fuzzy-rough approximation (FRA).

Finally, classification is performed using the positive and selected negative samples. We have evaluated the efficacy of DTI-SNNFRA using AUC (Area under ROC Curve), Geometric Mean, and F1 Score.

Structure Elucidation and Identification of Novel Lead Molecules against Sulfur Import Protein cysA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,37448368,"Aims: The present work considers the Sulphate import ABC transporter protein (cysA) as a potential drug target for the identification of inhibitors for the protein. Background: The ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporters play a crucial role in the survival and virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by the acquisition of micronutrients from host tissue. Objectives: The 3D structural features of the cysA protein are built. Molecular scaffolds are identified by implementing active site identification, ADME properties, Virtual Screening, and a few other computational techniques. Methods: The theoretical model of cysA is predicted using homology modeling protocols, and the structure is validated by various validation methods. The prediction of partial dimer formation through protein-protein docking methods gave insight into the conformational changes taking place in the cysA protein. The natural substrate ATP is docked with cysA protein that confirms the ATP binding site. To find the drug-like compounds, virtual screening studies were carried out around the active site by several ligand databases.

Identification of Potential Aldose Reductase Inhibitors Using Convolutional Neural Network-Based in Silico Screening.,37788831,"Aldose reductase (ALR2) is a notable enzyme of the polyol pathway responsible for aggravating diabetic neuropathy complications.

Though considerable effort has been pushed toward the successful discovery of potent inhibitors, its discovery still remains an elusive task. To this end, we present a 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) based ALR2 inhibitor classification technique by dealing with snapshots of images captured from 3D chemical structures with multiple rotations as input data. The CNN-based architecture was trained on the 360 sets of image data along each axis and further prediction on the Maybridge library by each of the models. Subjecting the retrieved hits to molecular docking leads to the identification of the top 10 molecules with high binding affinity. The hits displayed a better blood-brain barrier penetration (BBB) score (90% with more than four scores) as compared to standard inhibitors (38%), reflecting the superior BBB penetrating efficiency of the hits. Followed by molecular docking, the biological evaluation spotlighted five compounds as promising ALR2 inhibitors and can be considered as a likely prospect for further structural optimization with medicinal chemistry efforts to improve their inhibition efficacy and consolidate them as new ALR2 antagonists in the future. In addition, the study also demonstrated the usefulness of scaffold analysis of the molecules as a method for investigating the significance of structurally diverse compounds in data-driven studies.

Multitype Perception Method for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction.,37314917,"With the growing popularity of artificial intelligence in drug discovery, many deep-learning technologies have been used to automatically predict unknown drug-target interactions (DTIs). A unique challenge in using these technologies to predict DTI is fully exploiting the knowledge diversity across different interaction types, such as drug-drug, drug-target, drug-enzyme, drug-path, and drug-structure types. Unfortunately, existing methods tend to learn the specifical knowledge on each interaction type and they usually ignore the knowledge diversity across different interaction types. Therefore, we propose a multitype perception method (MPM) for DTI prediction by exploiting knowledge diversity across different link types. The method consists of two main components: a type perceptor and a multitype predictor. The type perceptor learns distinguished edge representations by retaining the specifical features across different interaction types; this maximizes the prediction performance for each interaction type. The multitype predictor calculates the type similarity between the type perceptor and predicted interactions, and the domain gate module is reconstructed to assign an adaptive weight to each type perceptor. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed MPM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in DTI prediction.",1,"Multitype Perception Method for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction.

Matrix factorization with denoising autoencoders for prediction of drug-target interactions.,35871213,"Drug-target interaction is crucial in the discovery of new drugs. Computational methods can be used to identify new drug-target interactions at low costs and with reasonable accuracy. Recent studies pay more attention to machine-learning methods, ranging from matrix factorization to deep learning, in the DTI prediction.

Also, we identify potential new driver genes that we obtain by analysing the gene clusters enriched in known drivers of ovarian cancer progression. We validated the top scoring genes identified as new drivers through database search and biomedical literature curation. Finally, we identify potential candidate drugs for repurposing that could be used in treatment of the identified patient subgroups by targeting their mutated gene products. We validated a large percentage of our drug-target predictions by using other databases and through literature curation."
DeepDTA: deep drug-target binding affinity prediction.,30423097,"The identification of novel drug-target (DT) interactions is a substantial part of the drug discovery process. Most of the computational methods that have been proposed to predict DT interactions have focused on binary classification, where the goal is to determine whether a DT pair interacts or not. However, protein-ligand interactions assume a continuum of binding strength values, also called binding affinity and predicting this value still remains a challenge. The increase in the affinity data available in DT knowledge-bases allows the use of advanced learning techniques such as deep learning architectures in the prediction of binding affinities. In this study, we propose a deep-learning based model that uses only sequence information of both targets and drugs to predict DT interaction binding affinities. The few studies that focus on DT binding affinity prediction use either 3D structures of protein-ligand complexes or 2D features of compounds. One novel approach used in this work is the modeling of protein sequences and compound 1D representations with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results show that the proposed deep learning based model that uses the 1D representations of targets and drugs is an effective approach for drug target binding affinity prediction. The model in which high-level representations of a drug and a target are constructed via CNNs achieved the best Concordance Index (CI) performance in one of our larger benchmark datasets, outperforming the KronRLS algorithm and SimBoost, a state-of-the-art method for DT binding affinity prediction. https://github.com/hkmztrk/DeepDTA.

"Bioactive plantaricins as potent anti-cancer drug candidates: double docking, molecular dynamics simulation and in vitro cytotoxicity analysis.",36775653,"The medical community is desperate for a reliable source of medications to alleviate the severity of conventional cancer treatments and prevent secondary microbial infections in oncological patients. In this regard, plantaricins from lactic acid bacteria were explored as prospective drug candidates against known anti-cancer drug targets. Three plantaricins, JLA-9, GZ1-27 and BN, have a binding affinity of -8.8, -8.6 and -7.2 kcal/mol, respectively, with squalene synthase (SQS), a key molecule in lung cancer metastasis. All three plantaricins displayed analogous binding patterns as SQS inhibitors and generated hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions with ARG 47, ARG 188, PHE24, LEU183 and PRO292. Structural stability of docked complexes was validated using molecular dynamics simulation derived parameters such as RMSD, RMSF and radius of gyration. Based on MD simulation results, conformational changes and stabilities of docked SQS/plantaricin complexes with respect to the time frame were evaluated using machine learning (logistic regression algorithm). Double docking with SQS/matrix metalloproteinase MMP1 and PCA analysis revealed the potential of plantaricin JLA-9 as a multi-substrate inhibitor. Further, plantaricin JLA-9 induced a significant cytotoxic response against the lung carcinoma cell line (A549) in a dose and time dependent manner with inhibition concentration (IC50) of 0.082 µg/ml after 48 h. However, plantaricin JLA-9 did not induce cytotoxicity in normal lung cells (L-132), as the IC50 value was not obtained even at a higher dose of 0.8 µg/ml. In silico pharmacokinetic (ADMET) profile implies that plantaricin JLA-9 could be developed as new age anti-cancer therapeutic with a preference for parenteral administration.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Predicting affinity through homology (PATH): interpretable binding affinity prediction with persistent homology,38014181,"Accurate binding affinity prediction is crucial to structure-based drug design. Recent work used computational topology to obtain an effective representation of protein-ligand interactions. Although persistent homology encodes geometric features, previous works on binding affinity prediction using persistent homology employed uninterpretable machine learning models and failed to explain the underlying geometric and topological features that drive accurate binding affinity prediction. In this work, we propose a novel, interpretable algorithm for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. Our algorithm achieves interpretability through an effective embedding of distances across bipartite matchings of the protein and ligand atoms into real-valued functions by summing Gaussians centered at features constructed by persistent homology. We name these functions <i>internuclear persistent contours (IPCs)</i> . Next, we introduce <i>persistence fingerprints</i> , a vector with 10 components that sketches the distances of different bipartite matching between protein and ligand atoms, refined from IPCs. Let the number of protein atoms in the protein-ligand complex be <i>n</i> , number of ligand atoms be <i>m</i> , and <i>ω</i> ≈ 2.4 be the matrix multiplication exponent. We show that for any 0 < <i>ε</i> < 1, after an 𝒪 ( <i>mn</i> log( <i>mn</i> )) preprocessing procedure, we can compute an <i>ε</i> -accurate approximation to the persistence fingerprint in 𝒪 ( <i>m</i> log <sup>6 <i>ω</i></sup> ( <i>m/""</i> )) time, independent of protein size. This is an improvement in time complexity by a factor of 𝒪 (( <i>m</i> + <i>n</i> ) <sup>3</sup> ) over any previous binding affinity prediction that uses persistent homology. We show that the representational power of persistence fingerprint generalizes to protein-ligand binding datasets beyond the training dataset. Then, we introduce <i>PATH</i> , Predicting Affinity Through Homology, an interpretable, small ensemble of shallow regression trees for binding affinity prediction from persistence fingerprints. We show that despite using 1,400-fold fewer features, PATH has comparable performance to a previous state-of-the-art binding affinity prediction algorithm that uses persistent homology features. Moreover, PATH has the advantage of being interpretable. Finally, we visualize the features captured by persistence fingerprint for variant HIV-1 protease complexes and show that persistence fingerprint captures binding-relevant structural mutations.

Graph Convolutional Autoencoder and Generative Adversarial Network-Based Method for Predicting Drug-Target Interactions.,32750854,"The computational prediction of novel drug-target interactions (DTIs) may effectively speed up the process of drug repositioning and reduce its costs.

We proposed a graph convolutional autoencoder and generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method, GANDTI, to predict DTIs.

A GAN was introduced to regularize the feature vectors of nodes into a Gaussian distribution. Severe class imbalance exists between known and unknown DTIs. Thus, we constructed a classifier based on an ensemble learning model, LightGBM, to estimate the interaction propensities of drugs and targets.
