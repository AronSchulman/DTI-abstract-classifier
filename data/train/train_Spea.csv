Ligand Binding Prediction Using Protein Structure Graphs and Residual Graph Attention Networks.,36014351,"Computational prediction of ligand-target interactions is a crucial part of modern drug discovery as it helps to bypass high costs and labor demands of in vitro and in vivo screening. As the wealth of bioactivity data accumulates, it provides opportunities for the development of deep

Affinity Regression) approach that utilizes 3D structural information of the proteins along with 2D graph representations of ligands. The method also introduces attention scores to selectively weight protein regions that are most important for ligand binding. Results: The developed approach
demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on several binding affinity benchmarking datasets. The attention-based pooling of protein graphs enables identification of surface residues as critical residues for protein-ligand binding. Finally, we validate our model predictions against an

NegStacking: Drug-Target Interaction Prediction Based on Ensemble Learning and Logistic Regression.,31985434,"Drug-target interactions (DTIs) identification is an important issue of drug research, and many methods proposed to predict potential DTIs based on machine learning treat it as a binary classification problem. However, the number of known interacting drug-target pairs (positive samples) is
far less than that of non-interacting pairs (negative samples). Most methods do not utilize these large numbers of negative samples sufficiently, which limits their prediction performance. To address this problem, we proposed a stacking framework named NegStacking. First, it uses sampling to obtain
multiple completely different negative sample sets. Then, each weak learner is trained with a different negative sample set and the same positive sample set, and the logistic regression (LR) is used as a meta-learner to adaptively combine these weak learners. Moreover, in the training process,
feature subspacing and hyperparameter perturbation are applied to increase ensemble diversity. Finally, the trained model could be used to predict new samples. We compared NegStacking with other methods, and the experimental results show that our model is superior. NegStacking can improve the

slightly better than our ligand-based methods (ρ = 0.543), and had equivalent performance with the other top methods in the competition. Despite the overall good performance of our methods in comparison to other participants in the challenge, there exists significant room for improvement especially
in cases such as these where protein flexibility plays such a large role."
DeepDTA: deep drug-target binding affinity prediction.,30423097,"The identification of novel drug-target (DT) interactions is a substantial part of the drug discovery process.

sequence similarity) networks to get prior knowledge. Second, the representation was learned using an advanced graph pre-training framework, VGAE, which could not only gather node features but also learn topological connections, therefore contributing to a richer protein representation and
benefiting the downstream DTA prediction task. This study provides new perspective for the DTA prediction task, and evaluation results demonstrated that MSF-DTA obtained superior performances compared to current state-of-the-art methods."

Predicting Affinity Through Homology (PATH): Interpretable Binding Affinity Prediction with Persistent Homology.,38014181,"Accurate binding affinity prediction is crucial to structure-based drug design.

experimental structural and biophysical data in order to train and validate a new tool, cutoff scanning matrix (CSM)-carbohydrate, using machine learning algorithms to accurately predict their binding affinity and rank docking poses as a scoring function. Information on both protein and carbohydrate
complementarity, in terms of shape and chemistry, was captured using graph-based structural signatures. Across both training and independent test sets, we achieved comparable Pearson's correlations of 0.72 under cross-validation [root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.58 Kcal/mol] and 0.67 on the
independent test (RMSE of 1.72 Kcal/mol), providing confidence in the generalisability and robustness of the final model. Similar performance was obtained across mono-, di- and oligosaccharides, further highlighting the applicability of this approach to the study of larger complexes. We show
CSM-carbohydrate significantly outperformed previous approaches and have implemented our method and make all data freely available through both a user-friendly web interface and application programming interface, to facilitate programmatic access at http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/csm_carbohydrate/. We
believe CSM-carbohydrate will be an invaluable tool for helping assess docking poses and the effects of mutations on protein-carbohydrate affinity, unravelling important aspects that drive binding recognition."
GIFDTI: Prediction of Drug-Target Interactions Based on Global Molecular and Intermolecular Interaction Representation Learning.,36445997,"Drug discovery and drug repurposing often rely on the successful prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs).

Beyond the predictive power on the effects of mutations, DLA is a general framework for transferring the knowledge gained from the available non-redundant set of complex protein structures to various tasks. For instance, given a single partially masked cube, it recovers the identity and
physicochemical class of the central residue. Given an ensemble of cubes representing an interface, it predicts the function of the complex. Source code and models are available at http://gitlab.lcqb.upmc.fr/DLA/DLA.git."
PPDTS: Predicting potential drug-target interactions based on network similarity.,34783172,"Identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) has great practical importance in the drug discovery process for known diseases.

Multitype Perception Method for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction.,37314917,"With the growing popularity of artificial intelligence in drug discovery, many deep-learning technologies have been used to automatically predict unknown drug-target interactions (DTIs).

Integrated unsupervised-supervised modeling and prediction of protein-peptide affinities at structural level.,35352094,"Cell signal networks are orchestrated directly or indirectly by various peptide-mediated protein-protein interactions, which are normally weak and transient and thus ideal for biological regulation and medicinal intervention.

types from thousands of solved PpI complex structures and then statistically correlates the potential descriptors with experimental affinities (KD values) over hundreds of known PpI samples in a supervised manner to create an integrated unsupervised-supervised PpI affinity (usPpIA) predictor.
Although both the ulPpI[a-r] potential and usPpIA predictor can be used to calculate PpI affinities from their complex structures, the latter seems to perform much better than the former, suggesting that the unsupervised potential can be improved substantially with a further correction by supervised

neglect of cooperative ligands and limited sampling of ligand binding poses. In Subchallenge 2, our workflow led to some of most highly correlated submissions (Pearson R = 0.5) for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. However, our results were poorly correlated for Janus Kinase 2 and
Mitogen-activated protein kinase 14. Affinity prediction could potentially be improved by systematic selection of more diverse receptor configurations."
A Comparative Assessment of Predictive Accuracies of Conventional and Machine Learning Scoring Functions for Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction.,26357221,"Accurately predicting the binding affinities of large diverse sets of protein-ligand complexes efficiently is a key challenge in computational biomolecular science, with applications in drug discovery, chemical biology, and structural biology. Since a scoring function (SF) is used to
score, rank, and identify potential drug leads, the fidelity with which it predicts the affinity of a ligand candidate for a protein's binding site has a significant bearing on the accuracy of virtual screening. Despite intense efforts in developing conventional SFs, which are either force-field
based, knowledge-based, or empirical, their limited predictive accuracy has been a major roadblock toward cost-effective drug discovery. Therefore, in this work, we explore a range of novel SFs employing different machine-learning (ML) approaches in conjunction with a variety of physicochemical and
geometrical features characterizing protein-ligand complexes. We assess the scoring accuracies of these new ML SFs as well as those of conventional SFs in the context of the 2007 and 2010 PDBbind benchmark datasets on both diverse and protein-family-specific test sets. We also investigate the
influence of the size of the training dataset and the type and number of features used on scoring accuracy. We find that the best performing ML SF has a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.806 between predicted and measured binding affinities compared to 0.644 achieved by a state-of-the-art
conventional SF. We also find that ML SFs benefit more than their conventional counterparts from increases in the number of features and the size of training dataset.

Prediction of Drug-Target Interactions Based on Network Representation Learning and Ensemble Learning.,32340959,"Identifying interactions between drugs and target proteins is a critical step in the drug development process, as it helps identify new targets for drugs and accelerate drug development.

Development and Evaluation of MM/GBSA Based on a Variable Dielectric GB Model for Predicting Protein-Ligand Binding Affinities.,32175734,"In structure-based drug design (SBDD), the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) approach has been widely used in ranking the binding affinity of small molecule ligands.

Energy Decomposition Analysis of Protein-Ligand Interactions Using Molecules-in-Molecules Fragmentation-Based Method.,31356073,"Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities and their quantitative decomposition into residue-specific contributions represent challenging problems in drug discovery.

computational cost. In this paper, we present a new approach for calculating protein-ligand interactions using our three-layer model (MIM3) that allows us to decompose the total binding affinity into quantitative contributions from individual residues (or backbone and side chain), crystal water

to identify and rationalize both obvious (e.g., hydrogen bonds, π···π) and nonobvious (e.g., CH···π) interactions that play a critical role in protein-ligand binding. We suggest that such quantitative information can be used to identify the key residues that determine the comparative binding
affinities of different ligands in order to improve and optimize the effectiveness of computational drug design.",1,"Energy Decomposition Analysis of Protein-Ligand Interactions Using Molecules-in-Molecules Fragmentation-Based Method. Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities and their quantitative decomposition into residue-specific contributions represent challenging problems in drug discovery. While quantum mechanical (QM) methods can provide an accurate description of such interactions, the associated
computational cost is normally prohibitive for broad-based applications. Recently, we have shown that QM-based protein-ligand interaction energies in the gas phase can be determined accurately using our multilayer molecules-in-molecules (MIM) fragmentation-based method at a significantly lower
computational cost. In this paper, we present a new approach for calculating protein-ligand interactions using our three-layer model (MIM3) that allows us to decompose the total binding affinity into quantitative contributions from individual residues (or backbone and side chain), crystal water
molecules, solvation energy, and entropy. In our approach, the desolvation energy and entropy changes during protein-ligand binding are modeled using simple and inexpensive empirical models while intermolecular interactions are computed using an accurate QM method. The performance of our approach

Identification of m<sup>6</sup>A methylation-related genes in cerebral ischaemia‒reperfusion of Breviscapus therapy based on bioinformatics methods.,37670341,"Cerebral ischaemia‒reperfusion (I/R) frequently causes late-onset neuronal damage. Breviscapine promotes autophagy in microvascular endothelial cells in I/R and can inhibit oxidative damage and apoptosis. However, the mediation mechanism of breviscapine on neuronal cell death is unclear.
First, transcriptome sequencing was performed on three groups of mice: the neuronal normal group (Control group), the oxygen-glucose deprivation/ reoxygenation group (OGD/R group) and the breviscapine administration group (Therapy group). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the OGD/R and
control groups and between the Therapy and OGD/R groups were obtained by the limma package. N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) methylation-related DEGs were selected by Pearson correlation analysis. Then, prediction and confirmation of drug targets were performed by Swiss Target
Prediction and UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) database, and key genes were obtained by Pearson correlation analysis between m<sup>6</sup>A-related DEGs and drug target genes. Next, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) were used to obtain the pathways of key
genes. Finally, a circRNA-miRNA‒mRNA network was constructed based on the mRNAs, circRNAs and miRNAs. A total of 2250 DEGs between the OGD/R and control groups and 757 DEGs between the Therapy and OGD/R groups were selected by differential analysis. A total of 7 m<sup>6</sup>A-related DEGs,
including Arl4d, Gm10653, Gm1113, Kcns3, Olfml2a, Stk26 and Tfcp2l1, were obtained by Pearson correlation analysis. Four key genes (Tfcp2l1, Kcns3, Olfml2a and Arl4d) were acquired, and GSEA showed that these key genes significantly participated in DNA repair, e2f targets and the g2m checkpoint. IPA
revealed that Tfcp2l1 played a significant role in human embryonic stem cell pluripotency. The circRNA-miRNA‒mRNA network showed that mmu_circ_0001258 regulated Tfcp2l1 by mmu-miR-301b-3p. In conclusion, four key genes, Tfcp2l1, Kcns3, Olfml2a and Arl4d, significantly associated with the treatment

How Far Are We from the Rapid Prediction of Drug Resistance Arising Due to Kinase Mutations?,33490784,"In all living organisms, protein kinases regulate various cell signaling events through phosphorylation.
