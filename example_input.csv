"Geometric graph learning with extended atom-types features for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction.. Understanding and accurately predicting protein-ligand binding affinity are essential in the drug design and discovery process. At present, machine learning-based methodologies are gaining popularity as a means of predicting binding affinity due to their efficiency and accuracy, as well as
the increasing availability of structural and binding affinity data for protein-ligand complexes. In biomolecular studies, graph theory has been widely applied since graphs can be used to model molecules or molecular complexes in a natural manner. In the present work, we upgrade the graph-based
learners for the study of protein-ligand interactions by integrating extensive atom types such as SYBYL and extended connectivity interactive features (ECIF) into multiscale weighted colored graphs (MWCG). By pairing with the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) machine learning algorithm, our
approach results in two different methods, namely <sup>sybyl</sup>GGL-Score and <sup>ecif</sup>GGL-Score. Both of our models are extensively validated in their scoring power using three commonly used benchmark datasets in the drug design area, namely CASF-2007, CASF-2013, and CASF-2016. The
performance of our best model <sup>sybyl</sup>GGL-Score is compared with other state-of-the-art models in the binding affinity prediction for each benchmark. While both of our models achieve state-of-the-art results, the SYBYL atom-type model <sup>sybyl</sup>GGL-Score outperforms other methods by a
wide margin in all benchmarks. Finally, the best-performing SYBYL atom-type model is evaluated on two test sets that are independent of CASF benchmarks."
"A novel method for drug-target interaction prediction based on graph transformers model.. Drug-target interactions (DTIs) prediction becomes more and more important for accelerating drug research and drug repositioning. Drug-target interaction network is a typical model for DTIs prediction. As many different types of relationships exist between drug and target, drug-target
interaction network can be used for modeling drug-target interaction relationship. Recent works on drug-target interaction network are mostly concentrate on drug node or target node and neglecting the relationships between drug-target. We propose a novel prediction method for modeling the
relationship between drug and target independently. Firstly, we use different level relationships of drugs and targets to construct feature of drug-target interaction. Then, we use line graph to model drug-target interaction. After that, we introduce graph transformer network to predict drug-target
interaction. This method introduces a line graph to model the relationship between drug and target. After transforming drug-target interactions from links to nodes, a graph transformer network is used to accomplish the task of predicting drug-target interactions."
"GPCNDTA: Prediction of drug-target binding affinity through cross-attention networks augmented with graph features and pharmacophores.. Drug-target affinity prediction is a challenging task in drug discovery. The latest computational models have limitations in mining edge information in molecule graphs, accessing to knowledge in pharmacophores, integrating multimodal data of the same biomolecule and realizing effective
interactions between two different biomolecules. To solve these problems, we proposed a method called Graph features and Pharmacophores augmented Cross-attention Networks based Drug-Target binding Affinity prediction (GPCNDTA). First, we utilized the GNN module, the linear projection unit and
self-attention layer to correspondingly extract features of drugs and proteins. Second, we devised intramolecular and intermolecular cross-attention to respectively fuse and interact features of drugs and proteins. Finally, the linear projection unit was applied to gain final features of drugs and
proteins, and the Multi-Layer Perceptron was employed to predict drug-target binding affinity. Three major innovations of GPCNDTA are as follows: (i) developing the residual CensNet and the residual EW-GCN to correspondingly extract features of drug and protein graphs, (ii) regarding pharmacophores
as a new type of priors to heighten drug-target affinity prediction performance, and (iii) devising intramolecular and intermolecular cross-attention, in which the intramolecular cross-attention realizes the effective fusion of different modal data related to the same biomolecule, and the
intermolecular cross-attention fulfills the information interaction between two different biomolecules in attention space. The test results on five benchmark datasets imply that GPCNDTA achieves the best performance compared with state-of-the-art computational models. Besides, relying on ablation
experiments, we proved effectiveness of GNN modules, pharmacophores and two cross-attention strategies in improving the prediction accuracy, stability and reliability of GPCNDA. In case studies, we applied GPCNDTA to predict binding affinities between 3C-like proteinase and 185 drugs, and observed
that most binding affinities predicted by GPCNDTA are close to corresponding experimental measurements."
"DataDTA: a multi-feature and dual-interaction aggregation framework for drug-target binding affinity prediction.. Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity (DTA) is crucial for drug discovery. The increase in the publication of large-scale DTA datasets enables the development of various computational methods for DTA prediction. Numerous deep learning-based methods have been proposed to
predict affinities, some of which only utilize original sequence information or complex structures, but the effective combination of various information and protein-binding pockets have not been fully mined. Therefore, a new method that integrates available key information is urgently needed to
predict DTA and accelerate the drug discovery process. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning-based predictor termed DataDTA to estimate the affinities of drug-target pairs. DataDTA utilizes descriptors of predicted pockets and sequences of proteins, as well as low-dimensional molecular
features and SMILES strings of compounds as inputs. Specifically, the pockets were predicted from the three-dimensional structure of proteins and their descriptors were extracted as the partial input features for DTA prediction. The molecular representation of compounds based on algebraic graph
features was collected to supplement the input information of targets. Furthermore, to ensure effective learning of multiscale interaction features, a dual-interaction aggregation neural network strategy was developed. DataDTA was compared with state-of-the-art methods on different datasets, and the
results showed that DataDTA is a reliable prediction tool for affinities estimation. Specifically, the concordance index (CI) of DataDTA is 0.806 and the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) value is 0.814 on the test dataset, which is higher than other methods. The codes and datasets of DataDTA are
available at https://github.com/YanZhu06/DataDTA."
"Supervised graph co-contrastive learning for drug-target interaction prediction.. Identification of Drug-Target Interactions (DTIs) is an essential step in drug discovery and repositioning. DTI prediction based on biological experiments is time-consuming and expensive. In recent years, graph learning-based methods have aroused widespread interest and shown certain
advantages on this task, where the DTI prediction is often modeled as a binary classification problem of the nodes composed of drug and protein pairs (DPPs). Nevertheless, in many real applications, labeled data are very limited and expensive to obtain. With only a few thousand labeled data, models
could hardly recognize comprehensive patterns of DPP node representations, and are unable to capture enough commonsense knowledge, which is required in DTI prediction. Supervised contrastive learning gives an aligned representation of DPP node representations with the same class label. In embedding
space, DPP node representations with the same label are pulled together, and those with different labels are pushed apart. We propose an end-to-end supervised graph co-contrastive learning model for DTI prediction directly from heterogeneous networks. By contrasting the topology structures and
semantic features of the drug-protein-pair network, as well as the new selection strategy of positive and negative samples, SGCL-DTI generates a contrastive loss to guide the model optimization in a supervised manner. Comprehensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our model
outperforms the SOTA methods significantly on the task of DTI prediction, especially in the case of cold start. Furthermore, SGCL-DTI provides a new research perspective of contrastive learning for DTI prediction. The research shows that this method has certain applicability in the discovery of
drugs, the identification of drug-target pairs and so on."
"Drug-target interaction prediction: A Bayesian ranking approach.. In silico prediction of drug-target interactions (DTI) could provide valuable information and speed-up the process of drug repositioning - finding novel usage for existing drugs. In our work, we focus on machine learning algorithms supporting drug-centric repositioning approach, which aims
to find novel usage for existing or abandoned drugs. We aim at proposing a per-drug ranking-based method, which reflects the needs of drug-centric repositioning research better than conventional drug-target prediction approaches. We propose Bayesian Ranking Prediction of Drug-Target Interactions
(BRDTI). The method is based on Bayesian Personalized Ranking matrix factorization (BPR) which has been shown to be an excellent approach for various preference learning tasks, however, it has not been used for DTI prediction previously. In order to successfully deal with DTI challenges, we extended
BPR by proposing: (i) the incorporation of target bias, (ii) a technique to handle new drugs and (iii) content alignment to take structural similarities of drugs and targets into account. Evaluation on five benchmark datasets shows that BRDTI outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in terms
of per-drug nDCG and AUC. BRDTI results w.r.t. nDCG are 0.929, 0.953, 0.948, 0.897 and 0.690 for G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR), Ion Channels (IC), Nuclear Receptors (NR), Enzymes (E) and Kinase (K) datasets respectively. Additionally, BRDTI significantly outperformed other methods (BLM-NII,
WNN-GIP, NetLapRLS and CMF) w.r.t. nDCG in 17 out of 20 cases. Furthermore, BRDTI was also shown to be able to predict novel drug-target interactions not contained in the original datasets. The average recall at top-10 predicted targets for each drug was 0.762, 0.560, 1.000 and 0.404 for GPCR, IC,
NR, and E datasets respectively. Based on the evaluation, we can conclude that BRDTI is an appropriate choice for researchers looking for an in silico DTI prediction technique to be used in drug-centric repositioning scenarios. BRDTI Software and supplementary materials are available online at
www.ksi.mff.cuni.cz/∼peska/BRDTI."
"HiSIF-DTA: A Hierarchical Semantic Information Fusion Framework for Drug-Target Affinity Prediction.. Accurately identifying drug-target affinity (DTA) plays a significant role in promoting drug discovery and has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Exploring appropriate protein representation methods and increasing the abundance of protein information is critical in enhancing
the accuracy of DTA prediction. Recently, numerous deep learning-based models have been proposed to utilize the sequential or structural features of target proteins. However, these models capture only the low-order semantics that exist in a single protein, while the high-order semantics abundant in
biological networks are largely ignored. In this article, we propose HiSIF-DTA'a hierarchical semantic information fusion framework for DTA prediction. In this framework, a hierarchical protein graph is constructed that includes not only contact maps as low-order structural semantics but also
protein-rotein interaction (PPI) networks as high-order functional semantics. Particularly, two distinct hierarchical fusion strategies (i.e., Top-down and Bottom-Up) are designed to integrate the different protein semantics, therefore contributing to a richer protein representation. Comprehensive
experimental results demonstrate that HiSIF-DTA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for prediction on the benchmark datasets of the DTA task. Further validation on binary tasks and visualization analysis demonstrates the generalization and interpretation abilities of the proposed method."
"DTI-HETA: prediction of drug-target interactions based on GCN and GAT on heterogeneous graph.. Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction plays an important role in drug repositioning, drug discovery and drug design. However, due to the large size of the chemical and genomic spaces and the complex interactions between drugs and targets, experimental identification of DTIs is costly
and time-consuming. In recent years, the emerging graph neural network (GNN) has been applied to DTI prediction because DTIs can be represented effectively using graphs. However, some of these methods are only based on homogeneous graphs, and some consist of two decoupled steps that cannot be
trained jointly. To further explore GNN-based DTI prediction by integrating heterogeneous graph information, this study regards DTI prediction as a link prediction problem and proposes an end-to-end model based on HETerogeneous graph with Attention mechanism (DTI-HETA). In this model, a
heterogeneous graph is first constructed based on the drug-drug and target-target similarity matrices and the DTI matrix. Then, the graph convolutional neural network is utilized to obtain the embedded representation of the drugs and targets. To highlight the contribution of different neighborhood
nodes to the central node in aggregating the graph convolution information, a graph attention mechanism is introduced into the node embedding process. Afterward, an inner product decoder is applied to predict DTIs. To evaluate the performance of DTI-HETA, experiments are conducted on two datasets.
The experimental results show that our model is superior to the state-of-the-art methods. Also, the identification of novel DTIs indicates that DTI-HETA can serve as a powerful tool for integrating heterogeneous graph information to predict DTIs."
"A Novel Approach for Drug-Target Interactions Prediction Based on Multimodal Deep Autoencoder.. Drug targets are biomacromolecules or biomolecular structures that bind to specific drugs and produce therapeutic effects. Therefore, the prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is important for disease therapy. Incorporating multiple similarity measures for drugs and targets is of
essence for improving the accuracy of prediction of DTIs. However, existing studies with multiple similarity measures ignored the global structure information of similarity measures, and required manual extraction features of drug-target pairs, ignoring the non-linear relationship among features. In
this paper, we proposed a novel approach MDADTI for DTIs prediction based on MDA. MDADTI applied random walk with restart method and positive pointwise mutual information to calculate the topological similarity matrices of drugs and targets, capturing the global structure information of similarity
measures. Then, MDADTI applied multimodal deep autoencoder to fuse multiple topological similarity matrices of drugs and targets, automatically learned the low-dimensional features of drugs and targets, and applied deep neural network to predict DTIs. The results of 5-repeats of 10-fold
cross-validation under three different cross-validation settings indicated that MDADTI is superior to the other four baseline methods. In addition, we validated the predictions of the MDADTI in six drug-target interactions reference databases, and the results showed that MDADTI can effectively
identify unknown DTIs."
"Prediction of drug-target interactions from multi-molecular network based on LINE network representation method.. The prediction of potential drug-target interactions (DTIs) not only provides a better comprehension of biological processes but also is critical for identifying new drugs. However, due to the disadvantages of expensive and high time-consuming traditional experiments, only a small section
of interactions between drugs and targets in the database were verified experimentally. Therefore, it is meaningful and important to develop new computational methods with good performance for DTIs prediction. At present, many existing computational methods only utilize the single type of
interactions between drugs and proteins without paying attention to the associations and influences with other types of molecules. In this work, we developed a novel network embedding-based heterogeneous information integration model to predict potential drug-target interactions. Firstly, a
heterogeneous multi-molecuar information network is built by combining the known associations among protein, drug, lncRNA, disease, and miRNA. Secondly, the Large-scale Information Network Embedding (LINE) model is used to learn behavior information (associations with other nodes) of drugs and
proteins in the network. Hence, the known drug-protein interaction pairs can be represented as a combination of attribute information (e.g. protein sequences information and drug molecular fingerprints) and behavior information of themselves. Thirdly, the Random Forest classifier is used for
training and prediction. In the results, under the five-fold cross validation, our method obtained 85.83% prediction accuracy with 80.47% sensitivity at the AUC of 92.33%. Moreover, in the case studies of three common drugs, the top 10 candidate targets have 8 (Caffeine), 7 (Clozapine) and 6
(Pioglitazone) are respectively verified to be associated with corresponding drugs. In short, these results indicate that our method can be a powerful tool for predicting potential drug-target interactions and finding unknown targets for certain drugs or unknown drugs for certain targets."
"GTAMP-DTA: Graph transformer combined with attention mechanism for drug-target binding affinity prediction.. Drug target affinity prediction (DTA) is critical to the success of drug development. While numerous machine learning methods have been developed for this task, there remains a necessity to further enhance the accuracy and reliability of predictions. Considerable bias in drug target
binding prediction may result due to missing structural information or missing information. In addition, current methods focus only on simulating individual non-covalent interactions between drugs and proteins, thereby neglecting the intricate interplay among different drugs and their interactions
with proteins. GTAMP-DTA combines special Attention mechanisms, assigning each atom or amino acid an attention vector. Interactions between drug forms and protein forms were considered to capture information about their interactions. And fusion transformer was used to learn protein characterization
from raw amino acid sequences, which were then merged with molecular map features extracted from SMILES. A self-supervised pre-trained embedding that uses pre-trained transformers to encode drug and protein attributes is introduced in order to address the lack of labeled data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both the Davis and KIBA datasets. Additionally, the model's performance undergoes evaluation using three distinct pooling layers (max-pooling, mean-pooling, sum-pooling) along with variations of the attention mechanism. GTAMP-DTA
shows significant performance improvements compared to other methods."
"Overfit deep neural network for predicting drug-target interactions.. Drug-target interactions (DTIs) prediction is an important step in drug discovery. As traditional biological experiments or high-throughput screening are high cost and time-consuming, many deep learning models have been developed. Overfitting must be avoided when training deep learning
models. We propose a simple framework, called OverfitDTI, for DTI prediction. In OverfitDTI, a deep neural network (DNN) model is overfit to sufficiently learn the features of the chemical space of drugs and the biological space of targets. The weights of trained DNN model form an implicit
representation of the nonlinear relationship between drugs and targets. Performance of OverfitDTI on three public datasets showed that the overfit DNN models fit the nonlinear relationship with high accuracy. We identified fifteen compounds that interacted with TEK, a receptor tyrosine kinase
contributing to vascular homeostasis, and the predicted AT9283 and dorsomorphin were experimentally demonstrated as inhibitors of TEK in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)."
"Drug-Target Interaction Prediction via Dual Laplacian Graph Regularized Logistic Matrix Factorization.. Drug-target interactions provide useful information for biomedical drug discovery as well as drug development. However, it is costly and time consuming to find drug-target interactions by experimental methods. As a result, developing computational approaches for this task is necessary and
has practical significance. In this study, we establish a novel dual Laplacian graph regularized logistic matrix factorization model for drug-target interaction prediction, referred to as DLGrLMF briefly. Specifically, DLGrLMF regards the task of drug-target interaction prediction as a weighted
logistic matrix factorization problem, in which the experimentally validated interactions are allocated with larger weights. Meanwhile, by considering that drugs with similar chemical structure should have interactions with similar targets and targets with similar genomic sequence similarity should
in turn have interactions with similar drugs, the drug pairwise chemical structure similarities as well as the target pairwise genomic sequence similarities are fully exploited to serve the matrix factorization problem by using a dual Laplacian graph regularization term. In addition, we design a
gradient descent algorithm to solve the resultant optimization problem. Finally, the efficacy of DLGrLMF is validated on various benchmark datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that DLGrLMF performs better than other state-of-the-art methods. Case studies are also conducted to validate
that DLGrLMF can successfully predict most of the experimental validated drug-target interactions."
"Modified linear regression predicts drug-target interactions accurately.. State-of-the-art approaches for the prediction of drug-target interactions (DTI) are based on various techniques, such as matrix factorisation, restricted Boltzmann machines, network-based inference and bipartite local models (BLM). In this paper, we propose the framework of Asymmetric
Loss Models (ALM) which is more consistent with the underlying chemical reality compared with conventional regression techniques. Furthermore, we propose to use an asymmetric loss model with BLM to predict drug-target interactions accurately. We evaluate our approach on publicly available real-world
drug-target interaction datasets. The results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art DTI techniques, including recent versions of BLM."
"DNN-DTIs: Improved drug-target interactions prediction using XGBoost feature selection and deep neural network.. Analysis and prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs) play an important role in understanding drug mechanisms, as well as drug repositioning and design. Machine learning (ML)-based methods for DTIs prediction can mitigate the shortcomings of time-consuming and labor-intensive
experimental approaches, while providing new ideas and insights for drug design. We propose a novel pipeline for predicting drug-target interactions, called DNN-DTIs. First, the target information is characterized by a number of features, namely, pseudo-amino acid composition, pseudo
position-specific scoring matrix, conjoint triad composition, transition and distribution, Moreau-Broto autocorrelation, and structural features. The drug compounds are subsequently encoded using substructure fingerprints. Next, eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is used to determine the subset of
non-redundant features of importance. The optimal balanced set of sample vectors is obtained by applying the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Finally, a DTIs predictor, DNN-DTIs, is developed based on a deep neural network (DNN) via a layer-by-layer learning scheme. Experimental
results indicate that DNN-DTIs achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art predictors with ACC values of 98.78%, 98.60%, 97.98%, 98.24% and 98.00% on Enzyme, Ion Channels (IC), GPCR, Nuclear Receptors (NR) and Kuang's datasets. Therefore, the accurate prediction performance of DNN-DTIs
makes it a favored choice for contributing to the study of DTIs, especially drug repositioning."
"Identification of drug-target interactions via multiple kernel-based triple collaborative matrix factorization.. Targeted drugs have been applied to the treatment of cancer on a large scale, and some patients have certain therapeutic effects. It is a time-consuming task to detect drug-target interactions (DTIs) through biochemical experiments. At present, machine learning (ML) has been widely applied
in large-scale drug screening. However, there are few methods for multiple information fusion. We propose a multiple kernel-based triple collaborative matrix factorization (MK-TCMF) method to predict DTIs. The multiple kernel matrices (contain chemical, biological and clinical information) are
integrated via multi-kernel learning (MKL) algorithm. And the original adjacency matrix of DTIs could be decomposed into three matrices, including the latent feature matrix of the drug space, latent feature matrix of the target space and the bi-projection matrix (used to join the two feature
spaces). To obtain better prediction performance, MKL algorithm can regulate the weight of each kernel matrix according to the prediction error. The weights of drug side-effects and target sequence are the highest. Compared with other computational methods, our model has better performance on four
test data sets."
"NerLTR-DTA: drug-target binding affinity prediction based on neighbor relationship and learning to rank.. Drug-target interaction prediction plays an important role in new drug discovery and drug repurposing. Binding affinity indicates the strength of drug-target interactions. Predicting drug-target binding affinity is expected to provide promising candidates for biologists, which can
effectively reduce the workload of wet laboratory experiments and speed up the entire process of drug research. Given that, numerous new proteins are sequenced and compounds are synthesized, several improved computational methods have been proposed for such predictions, but there are still some
challenges. (i) Many methods only discuss and implement one application scenario, they focus on drug repurposing and ignore the discovery of new drugs and targets. (ii) Many methods do not consider the priority order of proteins (or drugs) related to each target drug (or protein). Therefore, it is
necessary to develop a comprehensive method that can be used in multiple scenarios and focuses on candidate order. In this study, we propose a method called NerLTR-DTA that uses the neighbor relationship of similarity and sharing to extract features, and applies a ranking framework with regression
attributes to predict affinity values and priority order of query drug (or query target) and its related proteins (or compounds). It is worth noting that using the characteristics of learning to rank to set different queries can smartly realize the multi-scenario application of the method, including
the discovery of new drugs and new targets. Experimental results on two commonly used datasets show that NerLTR-DTA outperforms some state-of-the-art competing methods. NerLTR-DTA achieves excellent performance in all application scenarios mentioned in this study, and the rm(test)2 values guarantee
such excellent performance is not obtained by chance. Moreover, it can be concluded that NerLTR-DTA can provide accurate ranking lists for the relevant results of most queries through the statistics of the association relationship of each query drug (or query protein). In general, NerLTR-DTA is a
powerful tool for predicting drug-target associations and can contribute to new drug discovery and drug repurposing. The proposed method is implemented in Python and Java. Source codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/RUXIAOQING964914140/NerLTR-DTA."
"Drug-target interaction prediction by integrating multiview network data.. Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is a challenging step in further drug repositioning, drug discovery and drug design. The advent of high-throughput technologies brings convenience to the development of DTI prediction methods. With the generation of a high number of data sets, many
mathematical models and computational algorithms have been developed to identify the potential drug-target pairs. However, most existing methods are proposed based on the single view data. By integrating the drug and target data from different views, we aim to get more stable and accurate prediction
results. In this paper, a multiview DTI prediction method based on clustering is proposed. We first introduce a model for single view drug-target data. The model is formulated as an optimization problem, which aims to identify the clusters in both drug similarity network and target protein
similarity network, and at the same time make the clusters with more known DTIs be connected together. Then the model is extended to multiview network data by maximizing the consistency of the clusters in each view. An approximation method is proposed to solve the optimization problem. We apply the
proposed algorithms to two views of data. Comparisons with some existing algorithms show that the multiview DTI prediction algorithm can produce more accurate predictions. For the considered data set, we finally predict 54 possible DTIs. From the similarity analysis of the drugs/targets, enrichment
analysis of DTIs and genes in each cluster, it is shown that the predicted DTIs have a high possibility to be true."
"MolTrans: Molecular Interaction Transformer for drug-target interaction prediction.. Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is a foundational task for in-silico drug discovery, which is costly and time-consuming due to the need of experimental search over large drug compound space. Recent years have witnessed promising progress for deep learning in DTI predictions.
However, the following challenges are still open: (i) existing molecular representation learning approaches ignore the sub-structural nature of DTI, thus produce results that are less accurate and difficult to explain and (ii) existing methods focus on limited labeled data while ignoring the value
of massive unlabeled molecular data. We propose a Molecular Interaction Transformer (MolTrans) to address these limitations via: (i) knowledge inspired sub-structural pattern mining algorithm and interaction modeling module for more accurate and interpretable DTI prediction and (ii) an augmented
transformer encoder to better extract and capture the semantic relations among sub-structures extracted from massive unlabeled biomedical data. We evaluate MolTrans on real-world data and show it improved DTI prediction performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The model scripts are
available at https://github.com/kexinhuang12345/moltrans. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
"Towards a more general drug target interaction prediction model using transfer learning.. The topic of Drug-Target Interaction (DTI) topic has emerged nowadays since the COVID-19 outbreaks. DTI is one of the stages of finding a new cure for a recent disease. It determines whether a chemical compound would affect a particular protein, known as binding affinity. Recently,
significant efforts have been devoted to artificial intelligence (AI) powered DTI. However, the use of transfer learning in DTI has not been explored extensively. This paper aims to make a more general DTI model by investigating DTI prediction method using Transfer learning. Three popular models
will be tested and observed: CNN, RNN, and Transformer. Those models combined in several scenarios involving two extensive public datasets on DTI (BindingDB and DAVIS) to find the most optimum architecture. In our finding, combining the CNN model and BindingDB as the source data became the most
recommended pre-trained model for real DTI cases. This conclusion was proved with the 6% AUPRC increase after fine-tuning the BindingDB pre-trained model to DAVIS dataset than without pre-training the model first."
"Machine Learning in Drug Metabolism Study.. Metabolic reactions in the body transform the administered drug into metabolites. These metabolites exhibit diverse biological activities. Drug metabolism is the major underlying cause of drug overdose-related toxicity, adversative drug effects and the drug's reduced efficacy. Though
metabolic reactions deactivate a drug, drug metabolites are often considered pivotal agents for off-target effects or toxicity. On the other side, in combination drug therapy, one drug may influence another drug's metabolism and clearance and is thus considered one of the primary causes of drug-drug
interactions. Today with the advancement of machine learning, the metabolic fate of a drug candidate can be comprehensively studied throughout the drug development procedure. Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Trees, different Boosting and Ensemble methods, Support
Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Network boosted Deep Learning are some machine learning algorithms which are being extensively used in such studies. Such tools are covering several attributes of drug metabolism, with an emphasis on the prediction of drug-drug interactions,
drug-target-interactions, clinical drug responses, metabolite predictions, sites of metabolism, etc. These reports are crucial for evaluating metabolic stability and predicting prospective drug-drug interactions, and can help pharmaceutical companies accelerate the drug development process in a less
resource-demanding manner than what in vitro studies offer. It could also help medical practitioners to use combinatorial drug therapy in a more resourceful manner. Also, with the help of the enormous growth of deep learning, traditional fields of computational drug development like molecular
interaction fields, molecular docking, quantitative structure-to-activity relationship (QSAR) studies and quantum mechanical simulations are producing results which were unimaginable couple of years back. This review provides a glimpse of a few contextually relevant machine learning algorithms and
then focuses on their outcomes in different studies."
"A Drug-Side Effect Context-Sensitive Network approach for drug target prediction.. Computational drug target prediction has become an important process in drug discovery. Network-based approaches are commonly used in computational drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction. Existing network-based approaches are limited in capturing the contextual information on how
diseases, drugs and genes are connected. Here, we proposed a context-sensitive network (CSN) model for DTI prediction by modeling contextual drug phenotypic relationships. We constructed a Drug-Side Effect Context-Sensitive Network (DSE-CSN) of 139 760 drug-side effect pairs, representing 1480 drugs
and 5868 side effects. We also built a protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) of 15 267 gene nodes and 178 972 weighted edges. A heterogeneous network was built by connecting the DSE-CSN and the PPIN through 3684 known DTIs. For each drug on the DSE-CSN, its genetic targets were predicted and
prioritized using a network-based ranking algorithm. Our approach was evaluated in both de novo and leave-one-out cross-validation analysis using known DTIs as the gold standard. We compared our DSE-CSN-based model to the traditional similarity-based network (SBN)-based prediction model. The results
suggested that the DSE-CSN-based model was able to rank known DTIs highly. In a de novo cross-validation, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.95. In a leave-one-out cross-validation, the average rank was top 3.2% for known DTIs. When it was compared to the
SBN-based model using the Precision-Recall curve, our CSN-based model achieved a higher mean average precision (MAP) (0.23 versus 0.19, P-value<1e-4) in a de novo cross-validation analysis. We further improved the CSN-based DTI prediction by differentially weighting the drug-side effect pairs on the
network and showed a significant improvement of the MAP (0.29 versus 0.23, P-value<1e-4). We also showed that the CSN-based model consistently achieved better performances than the traditional SBN-based model across different drug classes. Moreover, we demonstrated that our novel DTI predictions can
be supported by published literature. In summary, the CSN-based model, by modeling the context-specific inter-relationships among drugs and side effects, has a high potential in drug target prediction. nlp/case/edu/public/data/DSE/CSN_DTI."
"Semi-supervised heterogeneous graph contrastive learning for drug-target interaction prediction.. Identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is an important step in drug discovery and drug repositioning. In recent years, graph-based methods have attracted great attention and show advantages on predicting potential DTIs. However, these methods face the problem that the known DTIs
are very limited and expensive to obtain, which decreases the generalization ability of the methods. Self-supervised contrastive learning is independent of labeled DTIs, which can mitigate the impact of the problem. Therefore, we propose a framework SHGCL-DTI for predicting DTIs, which supplements
the classical semi-supervised DTI prediction task with an auxiliary graph contrastive learning module. Specifically, we generate representations for the nodes through the neighbor view and meta-path view, and define positive and negative pairs to maximize the similarity between positive pairs from
different views. Subsequently, SHGCL-DTI reconstructs the original heterogeneous network to predict the potential DTIs. The experiments on the public dataset show that SHGCL-DTI has significant improvement in different scenarios, compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate
that the contrastive learning module improves the prediction performance and generalization ability of SHGCL-DTI through ablation study. In addition, we have found several novel predicted DTIs supported by the biological literature. The data and source code are available at:
https://github.com/TOJSSE-iData/SHGCL-DTI."
"MMDTA: A Multimodal Deep Model for Drug-Target Affinity with a Hybrid Fusion Strategy.. The prediction of the drug-target affinity (DTA) plays an important role in evaluating molecular druggability. Although deep learning-based models for DTA prediction have been extensively attempted, there are rare reports on multimodal models that leverage various fusion strategies to
exploit heterogeneous information from multiple different modalities of drugs and targets. In this study, we proposed a multimodal deep model named MMDTA, which integrated the heterogeneous information from various modalities of drugs and targets using a hybrid fusion strategy to enhance DTA
prediction. To achieve this, MMDTA first employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to extract diverse heterogeneous information from the sequences and structures of drugs and targets. It then utilized a hybrid fusion strategy to combine and complement the
extracted heterogeneous information, resulting in the fused modal information for predicting drug-target affinity through the fully connected (FC) layers. Experimental results demonstrated that MMDTA outperformed the competitive state-of-the-art deep learning models on the widely used benchmark data
sets, particularly with a significantly improved key evaluation metric, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Furthermore, MMDTA exhibited excellent generalization and practical application performance on multiple different data sets. These findings highlighted MMDTA's accuracy and reliability in
predicting the drug-target binding affinity. For researchers interested in the source data and code, they are accessible at http://github.com/dldxzx/MMDTA."
"Improved prediction of drug-target interactions based on ensemble learning with fuzzy local ternary pattern.. <b>Introduction</b>: The prediction of interacting drug-target pairs plays an essential role in the field of drug repurposing, and drug discovery. Although biotechnology and chemical technology have made extraordinary progress, the process of dose-response experiments and clinical trials
is still extremely complex, laborious, and costly. As a result, a robust computer-aided model is of an urgent need to predict drug-target interactions (DTIs). <b>Methods</b>: In this paper, we report a novel computational approach combining fuzzy local ternary pattern (FLTP), Position-Specific
Scoring Matrix (PSSM), and rotation forest (RF) to identify DTIs. More specially, the target primary sequence is first numerically characterized into PSSM which records the biological evolution information. Afterward, the FLTP method is applied in extracting the highly representative descriptors of
PSSM, and the combinations of FLTP descriptors and drug molecular fingerprints are regarded as the complete features of drug-target pairs. <b>Results</b>: Finally, the entire features are fed into rotation forests for inferring potential DTIs. The experiments of 5-fold cross-validation (CV) achieve
mean accuracies of 89.08%, 86.14%, 82.41%, and 78.40% on Enzyme, Ion Channel, GPCRs, and Nuclear Receptor datasets. <b>Discussion</b>: For further validating the model performance, we performed experiments with the state-of-art support vector machine (SVM) and light gradient boosting machine (LGBM).
The experimental results indicate the superiorities of the proposed model in effectively and reliably detect potential DTIs. There is an anticipation that the proposed model can establish a feasible and convenient tool to identify high-throughput identification of DTIs."
"EFMSDTI: Drug-target interaction prediction based on an efficient fusion of multi-source data.. Accurate identification of Drug Target Interactions (DTIs) is of great significance for understanding the mechanism of drug treatment and discovering new drugs for disease treatment. Currently, computational methods of DTIs prediction that combine drug and target multi-source data can
effectively reduce the cost and time of drug development. However, in multi-source data processing, the contribution of different source data to DTIs is often not considered. Therefore, how to make full use of the contribution of different source data to predict DTIs for efficient fusion is the key
to improving the prediction accuracy of DTIs. In this paper, considering the contribution of different source data to DTIs prediction, a DTIs prediction approach based on an effective fusion of drug and target multi-source data is proposed, named EFMSDTI. EFMSDTI first builds 15 similarity networks
based on multi-source information networks classified as topological and semantic graphs of drugs and targets according to their biological characteristics. Then, the multi-networks are fused by selective and entropy weighting based on similarity network fusion (SNF) according to their contribution
to DTIs prediction. The deep neural networks model learns the embedding of low-dimensional vectors of drugs and targets. Finally, the LightGBM algorithm based on Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is used to complete DTIs prediction. Experimental results show that EFMSDTI has better performance
(AUROC and AUPR are 0.982) than several state-of-the-art algorithms. Also, it has a good effect on analyzing the top 1000 prediction results, while 990 of the first 1000DTIs were confirmed. Code and data are available at https://github.com/meng-jie/EFMSDTI."
"Identifying drug-target interactions via heterogeneous graph attention networks combined with cross-modal similarities.. Accurate identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) plays a crucial role in drug discovery. Compared with traditional experimental methods that are labor-intensive and time-consuming, computational methods are more and more popular in recent years. Conventional computational methods
almost simply view heterogeneous networks which integrate diverse drug-related and target-related dataset instead of fully exploring drug and target similarities. In this paper, we propose a new method, named DTIHNC, for $\mathbf{D}$rug-$\mathbf{T}$arget $\mathbf{I}$nteraction identification, which
integrates $\mathbf{H}$eterogeneous $\mathbf{N}$etworks and $\mathbf{C}$ross-modal similarities calculated by relations between drugs, proteins, diseases and side effects. Firstly, the low-dimensional features of drugs, proteins, diseases and side effects are obtained from original features by a
denoising autoencoder. Then, we construct a heterogeneous network across drug, protein, disease and side-effect nodes. In heterogeneous network, we exploit the heterogeneous graph attention operations to update the embedding of a node based on information in its 1-hop neighbors, and for multi-hop
neighbor information, we propose random walk with restart aware graph attention to integrate more information through a larger neighborhood region. Next, we calculate cross-modal drug and protein similarities from cross-scale relations between drugs, proteins, diseases and side effects. Finally, a
multiple-layer convolutional neural network deeply integrates similarity information of drugs and proteins with the embedding features obtained from heterogeneous graph attention network. Experiments have demonstrated its effectiveness and better performance than state-of-the-art methods. Datasets
and a stand-alone package are provided on Github with website https://github.com/ningq669/DTIHNC."
"Drug-Target Interaction Prediction with Graph Regularized Matrix Factorization.. Experimental determination of drug-target interactions is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a continuous demand for more accurate predictions of interactions using computational techniques. Algorithms have been devised to infer novel interactions on a global scale where the
input to these algorithms is a drug-target network (i.e., a bipartite graph where edges connect pairs of drugs and targets that are known to interact). However, these algorithms had difficulty predicting interactions involving new drugs or targets for which there are no known interactions (i.e.,
""orphan"" nodes in the network). Since data usually lie on or near to low-dimensional non-linear manifolds, we propose two matrix factorization methods that use graph regularization in order to learn such manifolds. In addition, considering that many of the non-occurring edges in the network are
actually unknown or missing cases, we developed a preprocessing step to enhance predictions in the ""new drug"" and ""new target"" cases by adding edges with intermediate interaction likelihood scores. In our cross validation experiments, our methods achieved better results than three other
state-of-the-art methods in most cases. Finally, we simulated some ""new drug"" and ""new target"" cases and found that GRMF predicted the left-out interactions reasonably well."
"PPAEDTI: Personalized Propagation Auto-Encoder Model for Predicting Drug-Target Interactions.. Identifying protein targets for drugs establishes an indispensable knowledge foundation for drug repurposing and drug development. Though expensive and time-consuming, vitro trials are widely employed to discover drug targets, and the existing relevant computational algorithms still cannot
satisfy the demand for real application in drug R&D with regards to the prediction accuracy and performance efficiency, which are urgently needed to be improved. To this end, we propose here the PPAEDTI model, which uses the graph personalized propagation technique to predict drug-target
interactions from the known interaction network. To evaluate the prediction performance, six benchmark datasets were used for testing with some state-of-the-art methods compared. As a result, using the 5-fold cross-validation, the proposed PPAEDTI model achieves average AUCs>90% on 5 collected
datasets. We also manually checked the top-20 prediction list for 2 proteins (hsa:775 and hsa:779) and a kind of drug (D00618), and successfully confirmed 18, 17, and 20 items from the public datasets, respectively. The experimental results indicate that, given known drug-target interactions, the
PPAEDTI model can provide accurate predictions for the new ones, which is anticipated to serve as a useful tool for pharmacology research. Using the proposed model that was trained with the collected datasets, we have built a computational platform that is accessible at http://120.77.11.78/PPAEDTI/
and corresponding codes and datasets are also released."
"A unified drug-target interaction prediction framework based on knowledge graph and recommendation system.. Prediction of drug-target interactions (DTI) plays a vital role in drug development in various areas, such as virtual screening, drug repurposing and identification of potential drug side effects. Despite extensive efforts have been invested in perfecting DTI prediction, existing methods
still suffer from the high sparsity of DTI datasets and the cold start problem. Here, we develop KGE_NFM, a unified framework for DTI prediction by combining knowledge graph (KG) and recommendation system. This framework firstly learns a low-dimensional representation for various entities in the KG,
and then integrates the multimodal information via neural factorization machine (NFM). KGE_NFM is evaluated under three realistic scenarios, and achieves accurate and robust predictions on four benchmark datasets, especially in the scenario of the cold start for proteins. Our results indicate that
KGE_NFM provides valuable insight to integrate KG and recommendation system-based techniques into a unified framework for novel DTI discovery."
"A multiple kernel learning algorithm for drug-target interaction prediction.. Drug-target networks are receiving a lot of attention in late years, given its relevance for pharmaceutical innovation and drug lead discovery. Different in silico approaches have been proposed for the identification of new drug-target interactions, many of which are based on kernel
methods. Despite technical advances in the latest years, these methods are not able to cope with large drug-target interaction spaces and to integrate multiple sources of biological information. We propose KronRLS-MKL, which models the drug-target interaction problem as a link prediction task on
bipartite networks. This method allows the integration of multiple heterogeneous information sources for the identification of new interactions, and can also work with networks of arbitrary size. Moreover, it automatically selects the more relevant kernels by returning weights indicating their
importance in the drug-target prediction at hand. Empirical analysis on four data sets using twenty distinct kernels indicates that our method has higher or comparable predictive performance than 18 competing methods in all prediction tasks. Moreover, the predicted weights reflect the predictive
quality of each kernel on exhaustive pairwise experiments, which indicates the success of the method to automatically reveal relevant biological sources. Our analysis show that the proposed data integration strategy is able to improve the quality of the predicted interactions, and can speed up the
identification of new drug-target interactions as well as identify relevant information for the task. The source code and data sets are available at www.cin.ufpe.br/~acan/kronrlsmkl/."
"SmartGraph: a network pharmacology investigation platform.. Drug discovery investigations need to incorporate network pharmacology concepts while navigating the complex landscape of drug-target and target-target interactions. This task requires solutions that integrate high-quality biomedical data, combined with analytic and predictive workflows as
well as efficient visualization. SmartGraph is an innovative platform that utilizes state-of-the-art technologies such as a Neo4j graph-database, Angular web framework, RxJS asynchronous event library and D3 visualization to accomplish these goals. The SmartGraph framework integrates high quality
bioactivity data and biological pathway information resulting in a knowledgebase comprised of 420,526 unique compound-target interactions defined between 271,098 unique compounds and 2018 targets. SmartGraph then performs bioactivity predictions based on the 63,783 Bemis-Murcko scaffolds extracted
from these compounds. Through several use-cases, we illustrate the use of SmartGraph to generate hypotheses for elucidating mechanism-of-action, drug-repurposing and off-target prediction. https://smartgraph.ncats.io/."
"A Biological Feature and Heterogeneous Network Representation Learning-Based Framework for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction.. The prediction of drug-target interaction (DTI) is crucial to drug discovery. Although the interactions between the drug and target can be accurately verified by traditional biochemical experiments, the determination of DTI through biochemical experiments is a time-consuming, laborious,
and expensive process. Therefore, we propose a learning-based framework named BG-DTI for drug-target interaction prediction. Our model combines two main approaches based on biological features and heterogeneous networks to identify interactions between drugs and targets. First, we extract original
features from the sequence to encode each drug and target. Later, we further consider the relationships among various biological entities by constructing drug-drug similarity networks and target-target similarity networks. Furthermore, a graph convolutional network and a graph attention network in
the graph representation learning module help us learn the features representation of drugs and targets. After obtaining the features from graph representation learning modules, these features are combined into fusion descriptors for drug-target pairs. Finally, we send the fusion descriptors and
labels to a random forest classifier for predicting DTI. The evaluation results show that BG-DTI achieves an average AUC of 0.938 and an average AUPR of 0.930, which is better than those of five existing state-of-the-art methods. We believe that BG-DTI can facilitate the development of drug
discovery or drug repurposing."
"DTI-MLCD: predicting drug-target interactions using multi-label learning with community detection method.. Identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) is an important step for drug discovery and drug repositioning. To reduce the experimental cost, a large number of computational approaches have been proposed for this task. The machine learning-based models, especially binary classification
models, have been developed to predict whether a drug-target pair interacts or not. However, there is still much room for improvement in the performance of current methods. Multi-label learning can overcome some difficulties caused by single-label learning in order to improve the predictive
performance. The key challenge faced by multi-label learning is the exponential-sized output space, and considering label correlations can help to overcome this challenge. In this paper, we facilitate multi-label classification by introducing community detection methods for DTI prediction, named
DTI-MLCD. Moreover, we updated the gold standard data set by adding 15,000 more positive DTI samples in comparison to the data set, which has widely been used by most of previously published DTI prediction methods since 2008. The proposed DTI-MLCD is applied to both data sets, demonstrating its
superiority over other machine learning methods and several existing methods. The data sets and source code of this study are freely available at https://github.com/a96123155/DTI-MLCD."
"Prediction of Drug-Target Interaction Using Dual-Network Integrated Logistic Matrix Factorization and Knowledge Graph Embedding.. Nowadays, drug-target interactions (DTIs) prediction is a fundamental part of drug repositioning. However, on the one hand, drug-target interactions prediction models usually consider drugs or targets information, which ignore prior knowledge between drugs and targets. On the other hand,
models incorporating priori knowledge cannot make interactions prediction for under-studied drugs and targets. Hence, this article proposes a novel dual-network integrated logistic matrix factorization DTIs prediction scheme (Ro-DNILMF) via a knowledge graph embedding approach. This model adds prior
knowledge as input data into the prediction model and inherits the advantages of the DNILMF model, which can predict under-studied drug-target interactions. Firstly, a knowledge graph embedding model based on relational rotation (RotatE) is trained to construct the interaction adjacency matrix and
integrate prior knowledge. Secondly, a dual-network integrated logistic matrix factorization prediction model (DNILMF) is used to predict new drugs and targets. Finally, several experiments conducted on the public datasets are used to demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the single
base-line model and some mainstream methods on efficiency."
"ColdDTA: Utilizing data augmentation and attention-based feature fusion for drug-target binding affinity prediction.. Accurate prediction of drug-target affinity (DTA) plays a crucial role in drug discovery and development. Recently, deep learning methods have shown excellent predictive performance on randomly split public datasets. However, verifications are still required on this splitting method to
reflect real-world problems in practical applications. And in a cold-start experimental setup, where drugs or proteins in the test set do not appear in the training set, the performance of deep learning models often significantly decreases. This indicates that improving the generalization ability of
the models remains a challenge. To this end, in this study, we propose ColdDTA: using data augmentation and attention-based feature fusion to improve the generalization ability of predicting drug-target binding affinity. Specifically, ColdDTA generates new drug-target pairs by removing subgraphs of
drugs. The attention-based feature fusion module is also used to better capture the drug-target interactions. We conduct cold-start experiments on three benchmark datasets, and the consistency index (CI) and mean square error (MSE) results on the Davis and KIBA datasets show that ColdDTA outperforms
the five state-of-the-art baseline methods. Meanwhile, the results of area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC-AUC) on the BindingDB dataset show that ColdDTA also has better performance on the classification task. Furthermore, visualizing the model weights allows for interpretable
insights. Overall, ColdDTA can better solve the realistic DTA prediction problem. The code has been available to the public."
"NHGNN-DTA: a node-adaptive hybrid graph neural network for interpretable drug-target binding affinity prediction.. Large-scale prediction of drug-target affinity (DTA) plays an important role in drug discovery. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have made great progress in DTA prediction by utilizing sequence or structural information of both drugs and proteins. However, sequence-based
algorithms ignore the structural information of molecules and proteins, while graph-based algorithms are insufficient in feature extraction and information interaction. In this article, we propose NHGNN-DTA, a node-adaptive hybrid neural network for interpretable DTA prediction. It can adaptively
acquire feature representations of drugs and proteins and allow information to interact at the graph level, effectively combining the advantages of both sequence-based and graph-based approaches. Experimental results have shown that NHGNN-DTA achieved new state-of-the-art performance. It achieved
the mean squared error (MSE) of 0.196 on the Davis dataset (below 0.2 for the first time) and 0.124 on the KIBA dataset (3% improvement). Meanwhile, in the case of cold start scenario, NHGNN-DTA proved to be more robust and more effective with unseen inputs than baseline methods. Furthermore, the
multi-head self-attention mechanism endows the model with interpretability, providing new exploratory insights for drug discovery. The case study on Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 illustrates the efficient utilization of drug repurposing in COVID-19. The source code and data are available at

"Prediction of Drug-Target Interactions From Multi-Molecular Network Based on Deep Walk Embedding Model.. Predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) is crucial in innovative drug discovery, drug repositioning and other fields. However, there are many shortcomings for predicting DTIs using traditional biological experimental methods, such as the high-cost, time-consumption, low efficiency, and
so on, which make these methods difficult to widely apply. As a supplement, the <i>in silico</i> method can provide helpful information for predictions of DTIs in a timely manner. In this work, a deep walk embedding method is developed for predicting DTIs from a multi-molecular network. More
specifically, a multi-molecular network, also called molecular associations network, is constructed by integrating the associations among drug, protein, disease, lncRNA, and miRNA. Then, each node can be represented as a behavior feature vector by using a deep walk embedding method. Finally, we
compared behavior features with traditional attribute features on an integrated dataset by using various classifiers. The experimental results revealed that the behavior feature could be performed better on different classifiers, especially on the random forest classifier. It is also demonstrated
that the use of behavior information is very helpful for addressing the problem of sequences containing both self-interacting and non-interacting pairs of proteins. This work is not only extremely suitable for predicting DTIs, but also provides a new perspective for the prediction of other
biomolecules' associations."
"ArkDTA: attention regularization guided by non-covalent interactions for explainable drug-target binding affinity prediction.. Protein-ligand binding affinity prediction is a central task in drug design and development. Cross-modal attention mechanism has recently become a core component of many deep learning models due to its potential to improve model explainability. Non-covalent interactions (NCIs), one of the
most critical domain knowledge in binding affinity prediction task, should be incorporated into protein-ligand attention mechanism for more explainable deep drug-target interaction models. We propose ArkDTA, a novel deep neural architecture for explainable binding affinity prediction guided by NCIs.
Experimental results show that ArkDTA achieves predictive performance comparable to current state-of-the-art models while significantly improving model explainability. Qualitative investigation into our novel attention mechanism reveals that ArkDTA can identify potential regions for NCIs between
candidate drug compounds and target proteins, as well as guiding internal operations of the model in a more interpretable and domain-aware manner. ArkDTA is available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/ArkDTA. kangj@korea.ac.kr."
"DeepNC: a framework for drug-target interaction prediction with graph neural networks.. The exploration of drug-target interactions (DTI) is an essential stage in the drug development pipeline. Thanks to the assistance of computational models, notably in the deep learning approach, scientists have been able to shorten the time spent on this stage. Widely practiced deep
learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks are commonly employed in DTI prediction projects. However, they can hardly utilize the natural graph structure of molecular inputs. For that reason, a graph neural network (GNN) is an applicable choice for
learning the chemical and structural characteristics of molecules when it represents molecular compounds as graphs and learns the compound features from those graphs. In an effort to construct an advanced deep learning-based model for DTI prediction, we propose Deep Neural Computation (DeepNC),
which is a framework utilizing three GNN algorithms: Generalized Aggregation Networks (GENConv), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNConv), and Hypergraph Convolution-Hypergraph Attention (HypergraphConv). In short, our framework learns the features of drugs and targets by the layers of GNN and 1-D
convolution network, respectively. Then, representations of the drugs and targets are fed into fully-connected layers to predict the binding affinity values. The models of DeepNC were evaluated on two benchmarked datasets (Davis, Kiba) and one independently proposed dataset (Allergy) to confirm that
they are suitable for predicting the binding affinity of drugs and targets. Moreover, compared to the results of baseline methods that worked on the same problem, DeepNC proves to improve the performance in terms of mean square error and concordance index."
"MFR-DTA: a multi-functional and robust model for predicting drug-target binding affinity and region.. Recently, deep learning has become the mainstream methodology for drug-target binding affinity prediction. However, two deficiencies of the existing methods restrict their practical applications. On the one hand, most existing methods ignore the individual information of sequence elements,
resulting in poor sequence feature representations. On the other hand, without prior biological knowledge, the prediction of drug-target binding regions based on attention weights of a deep neural network could be difficult to verify, which may bring adverse interference to biological researchers.
We propose a novel Multi-Functional and Robust Drug-Target binding Affinity prediction (MFR-DTA) method to address the above issues. Specifically, we design a new biological sequence feature extraction block, namely BioMLP, that assists the model in extracting individual features of sequence
elements. Then, we propose a new Elem-feature fusion block to refine the extracted features. After that, we construct a Mix-Decoder block that extracts drug-target interaction information and predicts their binding regions simultaneously. Last, we evaluate MFR-DTA on two benchmarks consistently with
the existing methods and propose a new dataset, sc-PDB, to better measure the accuracy of binding region prediction. We also visualize some samples to demonstrate the locations of their binding sites and the predicted multi-scale interaction regions. The proposed method achieves excellent
performance on these datasets, demonstrating its merits and superiority over the state-of-the-art methods. https://github.com/JU-HuaY/MFR."
"AMMVF-DTI: A Novel Model Predicting Drug-Target Interactions Based on Attention Mechanism and Multi-View Fusion.. Accurate identification of potential drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a crucial task in drug development and repositioning. Despite the remarkable progress achieved in recent years, improving the performance of DTI prediction still presents significant challenges. In this study, we
propose a novel end-to-end deep learning model called AMMVF-DTI (attention mechanism and multi-view fusion), which leverages a multi-head self-attention mechanism to explore varying degrees of interaction between drugs and target proteins. More importantly, AMMVF-DTI extracts interactive features
between drugs and proteins from both node-level and graph-level embeddings, enabling a more effective modeling of DTIs. This advantage is generally lacking in existing DTI prediction models. Consequently, when compared to many of the start-of-the-art methods, AMMVF-DTI demonstrated excellent
performance on the human, <i>C. elegans</i>, and DrugBank baseline datasets, which can be attributed to its ability to incorporate interactive information and mine features from both local and global structures. The results from additional ablation experiments also confirmed the importance of each
module in our AMMVF-DTI model. Finally, a case study is presented utilizing our model for COVID-19-related DTI prediction. We believe the AMMVF-DTI model can not only achieve reasonable accuracy in DTI prediction, but also provide insights into the understanding of potential interactions between
drugs and targets."
"Predicting Drug-Target Interactions Based on the Ensemble Models of Multiple Feature Pairs.. Backgroud: The prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is of great significance in drug development. It is time-consuming and expensive in traditional experimental methods. Machine learning can reduce the cost of prediction and is limited by the characteristics of imbalanced datasets
and problems of essential feature selection. The prediction method based on the Ensemble model of Multiple Feature Pairs (Ensemble-MFP) is introduced. Firstly, three negative sets are generated according to the Euclidean distance of three feature pairs. Then, the negative samples of the validation
set/test set are randomly selected from the union set of the three negative sets in the validation set/test set. At the same time, the ensemble model with weight is optimized and applied to the test set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (area under ROC, AUC) in three out of
four sub-datasets in gold standard datasets was more than 94.0% in the prediction of new drugs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is also shown with the comparison of state-of-the-art methods and demonstration of predicted drug-target pairs. The Ensemble-MFP can weigh the existing feature
pairs and has a good prediction effect for general prediction on new drugs."
"Nonlinear data fusion over Entity-Relation graphs for Drug-Target Interaction prediction.. The prediction of reliable Drug-Target Interactions (DTIs) is a key task in computer-aided drug design and repurposing. Here, we present a new approach based on data fusion for DTI prediction built on top of the NXTfusion library, which generalizes the Matrix Factorization paradigm by
extending it to the nonlinear inference over Entity-Relation graphs. We benchmarked our approach on five datasets and we compared our models against state-of-the-art methods. Our models outperform most of the existing methods and, simultaneously, retain the flexibility to predict both DTIs as binary
classification and regression of the real-valued drug-target affinity, competing with models built explicitly for each task. Moreover, our findings suggest that the validation of DTI methods should be stricter than what has been proposed in some previous studies, focusing more on mimicking real-life
DTI settings where predictions for previously unseen drugs, proteins, and drug-protein pairs are needed. These settings are exactly the context in which the benefit of integrating heterogeneous information with our Entity-Relation data fusion approach is the most evident. All software and data are
available at https://github.com/eugeniomazzone/CPI-NXTFusion and https://pypi.org/project/NXTfusion/."
"A Systematic Prediction of Drug-Target Interactions Using Molecular Fingerprints and Protein Sequences.. Drug-Target Interactions (DTI) play a crucial role in discovering new drug candidates and finding new proteins to target for drug development. Although the number of detected DTI obtained by high-throughput techniques has been increasing, the number of known DTI is still limited. On the
other hand, the experimental methods for detecting the interactions among drugs and proteins are costly and inefficient. Therefore, computational approaches for predicting DTI are drawing increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, we report a novel computational model for predicting the
DTI using extremely randomized trees model and protein amino acids information. More specifically, the protein sequence is represented as a Pseudo Substitution Matrix Representation (Pseudo-SMR) descriptor in which the influence of biological evolutionary information is retained. For the
representation of drug molecules, a novel fingerprint feature vector is utilized to describe its substructure information. Then the DTI pair is characterized by concatenating the two vector spaces of protein sequence and drug substructure. Finally, the proposed method is explored for predicting the
DTI on four benchmark datasets: Enzyme, Ion Channel, GPCRs and Nuclear Receptor. The experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves promising prediction accuracies of 89.85%, 87.87%, 82.99% and 81.67%, respectively. For further evaluation, we compared the performance of Extremely
Randomized Trees model with that of the state-of-the-art Support Vector Machine classifier. And we also compared the proposed model with existing computational models, and confirmed 15 potential drug-target interactions by looking for existing databases. The experiment results show that the proposed
method is feasible and promising for predicting drug-target interactions for new drug candidate screening based on sizeable features."
"Predicting Drug-Target Interactions Based on Small Positive Samples.. A basic task in drug discovery is to find new medication in the form of candidate compounds that act on a target protein. In other words, a drug has to interact with a target and such drug-target interaction (DTI) is not expected to be random. Significant and interesting patterns are
expected to be hidden in them. If these patterns can be discovered, new drugs are expected to be more easily discoverable. Currently, a number of computational methods have been proposed to predict DTIs based on their similarity. However, such as approach does not allow biochemical features to be
directly considered. As a result, some methods have been proposed to try to discover patterns in physicochemical interactions. Since the number of potential negative DTIs are very high both in absolute terms and in comparison to that of the known ones, these methods are rather computationally
expensive and they can only rely on subsets, rather than the full set, of negative DTIs for training and validation. As there is always a relatively high chance for negative DTIs to be falsely identified and as only partial subset of such DTIs is considered, existing approaches can be further
improved to better predict DTIs. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called ODT (one class drug target interaction prediction), for such purpose. One main task of ODT is to discover association patterns between interacting drugs and proteins from the chemical structure of the former and the
protein sequence network of the latter. ODT does so in two phases. First, the DTI-network is transformed to a representation by structural properties. Second, it applies a oneclass classification algorithm to build a prediction model based only on known positive interactions. We compared the best
AUROC scores of the ODT with several state-of-art approaches on Gold standard data. The prediction accuracy of the ODT is superior in comparison with all the other methods at GPCRs dataset and Ion channels dataset. Performance evaluation of ODT shows that it can be potentially useful. It confirms
that predicting potential or missing DTIs based on the known interactions is a promising direction to solve problems related to the use of uncertain and unreliable negative samples and those related to the great demand in computational resources."
"The Discovery of New Drug-Target Interactions for Breast Cancer Treatment.. Drug-target interaction (DTIs) prediction plays a vital role in probing new targets for breast cancer research. Considering the multifaceted challenges associated with experimental methods identifying DTIs, the in silico prediction of such interactions merits exploration. In this study, we
develop a feature-based method to infer unknown DTIs, called PsePDC-DTIs, which fuses information regarding protein sequences extracted by pseudo-position specific scoring matrix (PsePSSM), detrended cross-correlation analysis coefficient (DCCA coefficient), and an FP2 format molecular fingerprint
descriptor of drug compounds. In addition, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is employed for dealing with the imbalanced data after Lasso dimensionality reduction. Then, the processed feature vectors are put into a random forest classifier to perform DTIs predictions on four gold
standard datasets, including nuclear receptors (NR), G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), ion channels (IC), and enzymes (E). Furthermore, we explore new targets for breast cancer treatment using its risk genes identified from large-scale genome-wide genetic studies using PsePDC-DTIs. Through
five-fold cross-validation, the average values of accuracy in NR, GPCR, IC, and E datasets are 95.28%, 96.19%, 96.74%, and 98.22%, respectively. The PsePDC-DTIs model provides us with 10 potential DTIs for breast cancer treatment, among which erlotinib (DB00530) and FGFR2 (hsa2263), caffeine
(DB00201) and KCNN4 (hsa3783), as well as afatinib (DB08916) and FGFR2 (hsa2263) are found with direct or inferred evidence. The PsePDC-DTIs model has achieved good prediction results, establishing the validity and superiority of the proposed method."
"ELECTRA-DTA: a new compound-protein binding affinity prediction model based on the contextualized sequence encoding.. Drug-target binding affinity (DTA) reflects the strength of the drug-target interaction; therefore, predicting the DTA can considerably benefit drug discovery by narrowing the search space and pruning drug-target (DT) pairs with low binding affinity scores. Representation learning using
deep neural networks has achieved promising performance compared with traditional machine learning methods; hence, extensive research efforts have been made in learning the feature representation of proteins and compounds. However, such feature representation learning relies on a large-scale
labelled dataset, which is not always available. We present an end-to-end deep learning framework, ELECTRA-DTA, to predict the binding affinity of drug-target pairs. This framework incorporates an unsupervised learning mechanism to train two ELECTRA-based contextual embedding models, one for protein
amino acids and the other for compound SMILES string encoding. In addition, ELECTRA-DTA leverages a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) convolutional neural network block stacked over three fully connected layers to further capture the sequential and spatial features of the protein sequence and SMILES for
the DTA regression task. Experimental evaluations show that ELECTRA-DTA outperforms various state-of-the-art DTA prediction models, especially with the challenging, interaction-sparse BindingDB dataset. In target selection and drug repurposing for COVID-19, ELECTRA-DTA also offers competitive
performance, suggesting its potential in speeding drug discovery and generalizability for other compound- or protein-related computational tasks."
"DTI-BERT: Identifying Drug-Target Interactions in Cellular Networking Based on BERT and Deep Learning Method.. Drug-target interactions (DTIs) are regarded as an essential part of genomic drug discovery, and computational prediction of DTIs can accelerate to find the lead drug for the target, which can make up for the lack of time-consuming and expensive wet-lab techniques. Currently, many
computational methods predict DTIs based on sequential composition or physicochemical properties of drug and target, but further efforts are needed to improve them. In this article, we proposed a new sequence-based method for accurately identifying DTIs. For target protein, we explore using
pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to extract sequence features, which can provide unique and valuable pattern information. For drug molecules, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is employed to generate information from drug molecular fingerprints. Then we
concatenate the feature vectors of the DTIs, and input them into a feature extraction module consisting of a batch-norm layer, rectified linear activation layer and linear layer, called BRL block and a Convolutional Neural Networks module to extract DTIs features further. Subsequently, a BRL block
is used as the prediction engine. After optimizing the model based on contrastive loss and cross-entropy loss, it gave prediction accuracies of the target families of G Protein-coupled receptors, ion channels, enzymes, and nuclear receptors up to 90.1, 94.7, 94.9, and 89%, which indicated that the
proposed method can outperform the existing predictors. To make it as convenient as possible for researchers, the web server for the new predictor is freely accessible at: https://bioinfo.jcu.edu.cn/dtibert or http://121.36.221.79/dtibert/. The proposed method may also be a potential option for
other DITs."
"SSELM-neg: spherical search-based extreme learning machine for drug-target interaction prediction.. The experimental verification of a drug discovery process is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, efficiently and effectively identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) has been the focus of research. At present, many machine learning algorithms are used for predicting DTIs. The key
idea is to train the classifier using an existing DTI to predict a new or unknown DTI. However, there are various challenges, such as class imbalance and the parameter optimization of many classifiers, that need to be solved before an optimal DTI model is developed. In this study, we propose a
framework called SSELM-neg for DTI prediction, in which we use a screening approach to choose high-quality negative samples and a spherical search approach to optimize the parameters of the extreme learning machine. The results demonstrated that the proposed technique outperformed other
state-of-the-art methods in 10-fold cross-validation experiments in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.986, 0.993, 0.988, and 0.969) and AUPR (0.982, 0.991, 0.982, and 0.946) for the enzyme dataset, G-protein coupled receptor dataset, ion channel dataset, and
nuclear receptor dataset, respectively. The screening approach produced high-quality negative samples with the same number of positive samples, which solved the class imbalance problem. We optimized an extreme learning machine using a spherical search approach to identify DTIs. Therefore, our models
performed better than other state-of-the-art methods."
"LM-DTI: a tool of predicting drug-target interactions using the node2vec and network path score methods.. <b>Introduction:</b> Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is a key step in drug function discovery and repositioning. The emergence of large-scale heterogeneous biological networks provides an opportunity to identify drug-related target genes, which led to the development of several
computational methods for DTI prediction. <b>Methods:</b> Considering the limitations of conventional computational methods, a novel tool named LM-DTI based on integrated information related to lncRNAs and miRNAs was proposed, which adopted the graph embedding (node2vec) and the network path score
methods. First, LM-DTI innovatively constructed a heterogeneous information network containing eight networks composed of four types of nodes (drug, target, lncRNA, and miRNA). Next, the node2vec method was used to obtain feature vectors of drug as well as target nodes, and the path score vector of
each drug-target pair was calculated using the DASPfind method. Finally, the feature vectors and path score vectors were merged and input into the XGBoost classifier to predict potential drug-target interactions. <b>Results and Discussion:</b> The 10-fold cross validations evaluate the
classification accuracies of the LM-DTI. The prediction performance of LM-DTI in AUPR reached 0.96, which showed a significant improvement compared with those of conventional tools. The validity of LM-DTI has also been verified by manually searching literature and various databases. LM-DTI is
scalable and computing efficient; thus representing a powerful drug relocation tool that can be accessed for free at http://www.lirmed.com:5038/lm_dti."
"Prediction of Drug-Target Interactions by Combining Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform with Ensemble Learning Method.. Identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is vital for drug discovery. However, traditional biological approaches have some unavoidable shortcomings, such as being time consuming and expensive. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel and effective computational methods
to predict DTIs in order to shorten the development cycles of new drugs. In this study, we present a novel computational approach to identify DTIs, which uses protein sequence information and the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). More specifically, a position-specific scoring matrix
(PSSM) was performed on the target protein sequence to obtain its evolutionary information. Then, DTCWT was used to extract representative features from the PSSM, which were then combined with the drug fingerprint features to form the feature descriptors. Finally, these descriptors were sent to the
Rotation Forest (RoF) model for classification. A 5-fold cross validation (CV) was adopted on four datasets (Enzyme, Ion Channel, GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors), and NRs (Nuclear Receptors)) to validate the proposed model; our method yielded high average accuracies of 89.21%, 85.49%, 81.02%,
and 74.44%, respectively. To further verify the performance of our model, we compared the RoF classifier with two state-of-the-art algorithms: the support vector machine (SVM) and the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier. We also compared it with some other published methods. Moreover, the prediction
results for the independent dataset further indicated that our method is effective for predicting potential DTIs. Thus, we believe that our method is suitable for facilitating drug discovery and development."
"DeepConv-DTI: Prediction of drug-target interactions via deep learning with convolution on protein sequences.. Identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) plays a key role in drug discovery. The high cost and labor-intensive nature of in vitro and in vivo experiments have highlighted the importance of in silico-based DTI prediction approaches. In several computational models, conventional
protein descriptors have been shown to not be sufficiently informative to predict accurate DTIs. Thus, in this study, we propose a deep learning based DTI prediction model capturing local residue patterns of proteins participating in DTIs. When we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) on raw
protein sequences, we perform convolution on various lengths of amino acids subsequences to capture local residue patterns of generalized protein classes. We train our model with large-scale DTI information and demonstrate the performance of the proposed model using an independent dataset that is
not seen during the training phase. As a result, our model performs better than previous protein descriptor-based models. Also, our model performs better than the recently developed deep learning models for massive prediction of DTIs. By examining pooled convolution results, we confirmed that our
model can detect binding sites of proteins for DTIs. In conclusion, our prediction model for detecting local residue patterns of target proteins successfully enriches the protein features of a raw protein sequence, yielding better prediction results than previous approaches. Our code is available at
https://github.com/GIST-CSBL/DeepConv-DTI."
"GraphATT-DTA: Attention-Based Novel Representation of Interaction to Predict Drug-Target Binding Affinity.. Drug-target binding affinity (DTA) prediction is an essential step in drug discovery. Drug-target protein binding occurs at specific regions between the protein and drug, rather than the entire protein and drug. However, existing deep-learning DTA prediction methods do not consider the
interactions between drug substructures and protein sub-sequences. This work proposes GraphATT-DTA, a DTA prediction model that constructs the essential regions for determining interaction affinity between compounds and proteins, modeled with an attention mechanism for interpretability. We make the
model consider the local-to-global interactions with the attention mechanism between compound and protein. As a result, GraphATT-DTA shows an improved prediction of DTA performance and interpretability compared with state-of-the-art models. The model is trained and evaluated with the Davis dataset,
the human kinase dataset; an external evaluation is achieved with the independently proposed human kinase dataset from the BindingDB dataset."
"A Network-Based Embedding Method for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction.. Integration of multi-omics and pharmacological data can help researchers understand the impact of drugs on dynamic biological systems. Network-based approaches to such integration explore the interaction of different cellular components and drugs. However, with ever-increasing amounts of
data, processing these high-dimensional biological networks requires powerful tools. We investigate whether network embeddings can address this problem by providing an effective method for dimensionality reduction in drug-related networks. A neural network-based embedding method is employed to
encode protein-protein, protein-disease, drug-drug and drug-disease networks for the prediction of novel drug-target interactions. We found that drug-target interaction prediction using embeddings of heterogeneous networks as input features performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods, exhibiting
an area under the ROC curve of 84%, outperforming methods such as BLM-NII and NetLapRLS, and coming very close to the best performing network methods such as HNM, CMF and DTINet. These encouraging results suggest that further investigation of this approach is warranted."
"LGBMDF: A cascade forest framework with LightGBM for predicting drug-target interactions.. Prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs) plays an important role in drug development. However, traditional laboratory methods to determine DTIs require a lot of time and capital costs. In recent years, many studies have shown that using machine learning methods to predict DTIs can
speed up the drug development process and reduce capital costs. An excellent DTI prediction method should have both high prediction accuracy and low computational cost. In this study, we noticed that the previous research based on deep forests used XGBoost as the estimator in the cascade, we applied
LightGBM instead of XGBoost to the cascade forest as the estimator, then the estimator group was determined experimentally as three LightGBMs and three ExtraTrees, this new model is called LGBMDF. We conducted 5-fold cross-validation on LGBMDF and other state-of-the-art methods using the same
dataset, and compared their Sn, Sp, MCC, AUC and AUPR. Finally, we found that our method has better performance and faster calculation speed."
"A point cloud-based deep learning strategy for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction.. There is great interest to develop artificial intelligence-based protein-ligand binding affinity models due to their immense applications in drug discovery. In this paper, PointNet and PointTransformer, two pointwise multi-layer perceptrons have been applied for protein-ligand binding
affinity prediction for the first time. Three-dimensional point clouds could be rapidly generated from PDBbind-2016 with 3772 and 11 327 individual point clouds derived from the refined or/and general sets, respectively. These point clouds (the refined or the extended set) were used to train
PointNet or PointTransformer, resulting in protein-ligand binding affinity prediction models with Pearson correlation coefficients R = 0.795 or 0.833 from the extended data set, respectively, based on the CASF-2016 benchmark test. The analysis of parameters suggests that the two deep learning models
were capable to learn many interactions between proteins and their ligands, and some key atoms for the interactions could be visualized. The protein-ligand interaction features learned by PointTransformer could be further adapted for the XGBoost-based machine learning algorithm, resulting in
prediction models with an average Rp of 0.827, which is on par with state-of-the-art machine learning models. These results suggest that the point clouds derived from PDBbind data sets are useful to evaluate the performance of 3D point clouds-centered deep learning algorithms, which could learn
atomic features of protein-ligand interactions from natural evolution or medicinal chemistry and thus have wide applications in chemistry and biology."
"SMPLIP-Score: predicting ligand binding affinity from simple and interpretable on-the-fly interaction fingerprint pattern descriptors.. In drug discovery, rapid and accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities is a pivotal task for lead optimization with acceptable on-target potency as well as pharmacological efficacy. Furthermore, researchers hope for a high correlation between docking score and pose with key
interactive residues, although scoring functions as free energy surrogates of protein-ligand complexes have failed to provide collinearity. Recently, various machine learning or deep learning methods have been proposed to overcome the drawbacks of scoring functions. Despite being highly accurate,
their featurization process is complex and the meaning of the embedded features cannot directly be interpreted by human recognition without an additional feature analysis. Here, we propose SMPLIP-Score (Substructural Molecular and Protein-Ligand Interaction Pattern Score), a direct interpretable
predictor of absolute binding affinity. Our simple featurization embeds the interaction fingerprint pattern on the ligand-binding site environment and molecular fragments of ligands into an input vectorized matrix for learning layers (random forest or deep neural network). Despite their less complex
features than other state-of-the-art models, SMPLIP-Score achieved comparable performance, a Pearson's correlation coefficient up to 0.80, and a root mean square error up to 1.18 in pK units with several benchmark datasets (PDBbind v.2015, Astex Diverse Set, CSAR NRC HiQ, FEP, PDBbind NMR, and
CASF-2016). For this model, generality, predictive power, ranking power, and robustness were examined using direct interpretation of feature matrices for specific targets."
"multi-type neighbors enhanced global topology and pairwise attribute learning for drug-protein interaction prediction.. Accurate identification of proteins interacted with drugs helps reduce the time and cost of drug development. Most of previous methods focused on integrating multisource data about drugs and proteins for predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs). There are both similarity connection and
interaction connection between two drugs, and these connections reflect their relationships from different perspectives. Similarly, two proteins have various connections from multiple perspectives. However, most of previous methods failed to deeply integrate these connections. In addition, multiple
drug-protein heterogeneous networks can be constructed based on multiple kinds of connections. The diverse topological structures of these networks are still not exploited completely. We propose a novel model to extract and integrate multi-type neighbor topology information, diverse similarities and
interactions related to drugs and proteins. Firstly, multiple drug-protein heterogeneous networks are constructed according to multiple kinds of connections among drugs and those among proteins. The multi-type neighbor node sequences of a drug node (or a protein node) are formed by random walks on
each network and they reflect the hidden neighbor topological structure of the node. Secondly, a module based on graph neural network (GNN) is proposed to learn the multi-type neighbor topologies of each node. We propose attention mechanisms at neighbor node level and at neighbor type level to learn
more informative neighbor nodes and neighbor types. A network-level attention is also designed to enhance the context dependency among multiple neighbor topologies of a pair of drug and protein nodes. Finally, the attribute embedding of the drug-protein pair is formulated by a proposed embedding
strategy, and the embedding covers the similarities and interactions about the pair. A module based on three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNN) is constructed to deeply integrate pairwise attributes. Extensive experiments have been performed and the results indicate GCDTI outperforms
several state-of-the-art prediction methods. The recall rate estimation over the top-ranked candidates and case studies on 5 drugs further demonstrate GCDTI's ability in discovering potential drug-protein interactions."
"Predicting drug-target binding affinity through molecule representation block based on multi-head attention and skip connection.. Exiting computational models for drug-target binding affinity prediction have much room for improvement in prediction accuracy, robustness and generalization ability. Most deep learning models lack interpretability analysis and few studies provide application examples. Based on these
observations, we presented a novel model named Molecule Representation Block-based Drug-Target binding Affinity prediction (MRBDTA). MRBDTA is composed of embedding and positional encoding, molecule representation block and interaction learning module. The advantages of MRBDTA are reflected in three
aspects: (i) developing Trans block to extract molecule features through improving the encoder of transformer, (ii) introducing skip connection at encoder level in Trans block and (iii) enhancing the ability to capture interaction sites between proteins and drugs. The test results on two benchmark
datasets manifest that MRBDTA achieves the best performance compared with 11 state-of-the-art models. Besides, through replacing Trans block with single Trans encoder and removing skip connection in Trans block, we verified that Trans block and skip connection could effectively improve the
prediction accuracy and reliability of MRBDTA. Then, relying on multi-head attention mechanism, we performed interpretability analysis to illustrate that MRBDTA can correctly capture part of interaction sites between proteins and drugs. In case studies, we firstly employed MRBDTA to predict binding
affinities between Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication-related proteins. Secondly, we compared true binding affinities between 3C-like proteinase and 185 drugs with those predicted by MRBDTA. The final results of
case studies reveal reliable performance of MRBDTA in drug design for SARS-CoV-2."
"An ensemble-based drug-target interaction prediction approach using multiple feature information with data balancing.. Recently, drug repositioning has received considerable attention for its advantage to pharmaceutical industries in drug development. Artificial intelligence techniques have greatly enhanced drug reproduction by discovering therapeutic drug profiles, side effects, and new target proteins.
However, as the number of drugs increases, their targets and enormous interactions produce imbalanced data that might not be preferable as an input to a prediction model immediately. This paper proposes a novel scheme for predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) based on drug chemical structures
and protein sequences. The drug Morgan fingerprint, drug constitutional descriptors, protein amino acid composition, and protein dipeptide composition were employed to extract the drugs and protein's characteristics. Then, the proposed approach for extracting negative samples using a support vector
machine one-class classifier was developed to tackle the imbalanced data problem feature sets from the drug-target dataset. Negative and positive samplings were constructed and fed into different prediction algorithms to identify DTIs. A 10-fold CV validation test procedure was applied to assess the
predictability of the proposed method, in addition to the study of the effectiveness of the chemical and physical features in the evaluation and discovery of the drug-target interactions. Our experimental model outperformed existing techniques concerning the curve for receiver operating
characteristic (AUC), accuracy, precision, recall F-score, mean square error, and MCC. The results obtained by the AdaBoost classifier enhanced prediction accuracy by 2.74%, precision by 1.98%, AUC by 1.14%, F-score by 3.53%, and MCC by 4.54% over existing methods."
"HIDTI: integration of heterogeneous information to predict drug-target interactions.. Identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) plays a crucial role in drug development. Traditional laboratory-based DTI discovery is generally costly and time-consuming. Therefore, computational approaches have been developed to predict interactions between drug candidates and
disease-causing proteins. We designed a novel method, termed heterogeneous information integration for DTI prediction (HIDTI), based on the concept of predicting vectors for all of unknown/unavailable heterogeneous drug- and protein-related information. We applied a residual network in HIDTI to
extract features of such heterogeneous information for predicting DTIs, and tested the model using drug-based ten-fold cross-validation to examine the prediction performance for unseen drugs. As a result, HIDTI outperformed existing models using heterogeneous information, and was demonstrating that
our method predicted heterogeneous information on unseen data better than other models. In conclusion, our study suggests that HIDTI has the potential to advance the field of drug development by accurately predicting the targets of new drugs."
"DeepPurpose: a deep learning library for drug-target interaction prediction.. Accurate prediction of drug-target interactions (DTI) is crucial for drug discovery. Recently, deep learning (DL) models for show promising performance for DTI prediction. However, these models can be difficult to use for both computer scientists entering the biomedical field and
bioinformaticians with limited DL experience. We present DeepPurpose, a comprehensive and easy-to-use DL library for DTI prediction. DeepPurpose supports training of customized DTI prediction models by implementing 15 compound and protein encoders and over 50 neural architectures, along with
providing many other useful features. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of DeepPurpose on several benchmark datasets. https://github.com/kexinhuang12345/DeepPurpose. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
"Exploring Landscape of Drug-Target-Pathway-Side Effect Associations.. Side effects are the second and the fourth leading causes of drug attrition and death in the US. Thus, accurate prediction of side effects and understanding their mechanism of action will significantly impact drug discovery and clinical practice. Here, we show REMAP, a
neighborhood-regularized weighted and imputed one-class collaborative filtering algorithm, is effective in predicting drug-side effect associations from a drug-side effect association network, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-target learning algorithm for predicting rare side
effects. We also apply FASCINATE, an extension of REMAP for multi-layered networks, to infer associations among side effects and drug targets from drug-target-side effect networks. Then, using random permutation analysis and gene overrepresentation tests, we infer statistically significant side
effect-pathway associations. The predicted drug-side effect associations and side effect-causing pathways are consistent with clinical evidences. We expect more novel drug-side effect associations and side effect-causing pathways to be identified when applying REMAP and FASCINATE to large-scale
chemical-gene-side effect networks."
"SE-OnionNet: A Convolution Neural Network for Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction.. Deep learning methods, which can predict the binding affinity of a drug-target protein interaction, reduce the time and cost of drug discovery. In this study, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network called SE-OnionNet, with two squeeze-and-excitation (SE) modules, to
computationally predict the binding affinity of a protein-ligand complex. The OnionNet is used to extract a feature map from the three-dimensional structure of a protein-drug molecular complex. The SE module is added to the second and third convolutional layers to improve the non-linear expression
of the network to improve model performance. Three different optimizers, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad, were also used to improve the performance of the model. A majority of protein-molecule complexes were used for training, and the comparative assessment of scoring functions
(CASF-2016) was used as the benchmark. Experimental results show that our model performs better than OnionNet, Pafnucy, and AutoDock Vina. Finally, we chose the macrophage migration inhibitor factor (PDB ID: 6cbg) to test the stability and robustness of the model. We found that the prediction
results were not affected by the docking position, and thus, our model is of acceptable robustness."
"MDTips: a multimodal-data-based drug-target interaction prediction system fusing knowledge, gene expression profile, and structural data.. Screening new drug-target interactions (DTIs) by traditional experimental methods is costly and time-consuming. Recent advances in knowledge graphs, chemical linear notations, and genomic data enable researchers to develop computational-based-DTI models, which play a pivotal role in drug
repurposing and discovery. However, there still needs to develop a multimodal fusion DTI model that integrates available heterogeneous data into a unified framework. We developed MDTips, a multimodal-data-based DTI prediction system, by fusing the knowledge graphs, gene expression profiles, and
structural information of drugs/targets. MDTips yielded accurate and robust performance on DTI predictions. We found that multimodal fusion learning can fully consider the importance of each modality and incorporate information from multiple aspects, thus improving model performance. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that deep learning-based encoders (i.e. Attentive FP and Transformer) outperform traditional chemical descriptors/fingerprints, and MDTips outperforms other state-of-the-art prediction models. MDTips is designed to predict the input drugs' candidate targets, side
effects, and indications with all available modalities. Via MDTips, we reverse-screened candidate targets of 6766 drugs, which can be used for drug repurposing and discovery. https://github.com/XiaoqiongXia/MDTips and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7560544."
"De Novo Prediction of Drug Targets and Candidates by Chemical Similarity-Guided Network-Based Inference.. Identifying drug-target interactions is a crucial step in discovering novel drugs and for drug repositioning. Network-based methods have shown great potential thanks to the straightforward integration of information from different sources and the possibility of extracting novel information
from the graph topology. However, despite recent advances, there is still an urgent need for efficient and robust prediction methods. Here, we present SimSpread, a novel method that combines network-based inference with chemical similarity. This method employs a tripartite drug-drug-target network
constructed from protein-ligand interaction annotations and drug-drug chemical similarity on which a resource-spreading algorithm predicts potential biological targets for both known or failed drugs and novel compounds. We describe small molecules as vectors of similarity indices to other compounds,
thereby providing a flexible means to explore diverse molecular representations. We show that our proposed method achieves high prediction performance through multiple cross-validation and time-split validation procedures over a series of datasets. In addition, we demonstrate that our method
performed a balanced exploration of both chemical ligand space (scaffold hopping) and biological target space (target hopping). Our results suggest robust and balanced performance, and our method may be useful for predicting drug targets, virtual screening, and drug repositioning."
"Drug-target interaction prediction using unifying of graph regularized nuclear norm with bilinear factorization.. Wet-lab experiments for identification of interactions between drugs and target proteins are time-consuming, costly and labor-intensive. The use of computational prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs), which is one of the significant points in drug discovery, has been considered by
many researchers in recent years. It also reduces the search space of interactions by proposing potential interaction candidates. In this paper, a new approach based on unifying matrix factorization and nuclear norm minimization is proposed to find a low-rank interaction. In this combined method, to
solve the low-rank matrix approximation, the terms in the DTI problem are used in such a way that the nuclear norm regularized problem is optimized by a bilinear factorization based on Rank-Restricted Soft Singular Value Decomposition (RRSSVD). In the proposed method, adjacencies between drugs and
targets are encoded by graphs. Drug-target interaction, drug-drug similarity, target-target, and combination of similarities have also been used as input. The proposed method is evaluated on four benchmark datasets known as Enzymes (E), Ion channels (ICs), G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and
nuclear receptors (NRs) based on AUC, AUPR, and time measure. The results show an improvement in the performance of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art techniques."
"Cuproptosis gene-related, neural network-based prognosis prediction and drug-target prediction for KIRC.. Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), as a common case in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), has the risk of postoperative recurrence, thus its prognosis is poor and its prognostic markers are usually based on imaging methods, which have the problem of low specificity. In addition,
cuproptosis, as a novel mode of cell death, has been used as a biomarker to predict disease in many cancers in recent years, which also provides an important basis for prognostic prediction in KIRC. For postoperative patients with KIRC, an important means of preventing disease recurrence is
pharmacological treatment, and thus matching the appropriate drug to the specific patient's target is also particularly important. With the development of neural networks, their predictive performance in the field of medical big data has surpassed that of traditional methods, and this also applies
to the field of prognosis prediction and drug-target prediction. The purpose of this study is to screen for cuproptosis genes related to the prognosis of KIRC and to establish a deep neural network (DNN) model for patient risk prediction, while also developing a personalized nomogram model for
predicting patient survival. In addition, sensitivity drugs for KIRC were screened, and a graph neural network (GNN) model was established to predict the targets of the drugs, in order to discover potential drug action sites and provide new treatment ideas for KIRC. We used the Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) database, International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) database, and DrugBank database for our study. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using TCGA data, and then a DNN-based risk prediction model was built and validated using ICGC data. Subsequently, the differences between
high- and low-risk groups were analyzed and KIRC-sensitive drugs were screened, and finally a GNN model was trained using DrugBank data to predict the relevant targets of these drugs. A prognostic model was built by screening 10 significantly different cuproptosis-related genes, the model had an AUC
of 0.739 on the training set (TCGA data) and an AUC of 0.707 on the validation set (ICGC data), which demonstrated a good predictive performance. Based on the prognostic model in this paper, patients were also classified into high- and low-risk groups, and functional analyses were performed. In
addition, 251 drugs were screened for sensitivity, and four drugs were ultimately found to have high sensitivity, with 5-Fluorouracil having the best inhibitory effect, and subsequently their corresponding targets were also predicted by GraphSAGE, with the most prominent targets including Cytochrome
P450 2D6, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A, and Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Ret. Notably, the average accuracy of GraphSAGE was 0.817 ± 0.013, which was higher than that of GAT and GTN. Our KIRC risk prediction model, constructed using 10 cuproptosis-related genes, had good
independent prognostic ability. In addition, we screened four highly sensitive drugs and predicted relevant targets for these four drugs that might treat KIRC. Finally, literature research revealed that four drug-target interactions have been demonstrated in previous studies and the remaining
targets are potential sites of drug action for future research."
"3DProtDTA: a deep learning model for drug-target affinity prediction based on residue-level protein graphs.. Accurate prediction of the drug-target affinity (DTA) <i>in silico</i> is of critical importance for modern drug discovery. Computational methods of DTA prediction, applied in the early stages of drug development, are able to speed it up and cut its cost significantly. A wide range of
approaches based on machine learning were recently proposed for DTA assessment. The most promising of them are based on deep learning techniques and graph neural networks to encode molecular structures. The recent breakthrough in protein structure prediction made by AlphaFold made an unprecedented
amount of proteins without experimentally defined structures accessible for computational DTA prediction. In this work, we propose a new deep learning DTA model 3DProtDTA, which utilises AlphaFold structure predictions in conjunction with the graph representation of proteins. The model is superior
to its rivals on common benchmarking datasets and has potential for further improvement."
"Does adding the drug-drug similarity to drug-target interaction prediction methods make a noticeable improvement in their efficiency?. Predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) has become an important bioinformatics issue because it is one of the critical and preliminary stages of drug repositioning. Therefore, scientists are trying to develop more accurate computational methods for predicting drug-target interactions.
These methods are usually based on machine learning or recommender systems and use biological and chemical information to improve the accuracy of predictions. In the background of these methods, there is a hypothesis that drugs with similar chemical structures have similar targets. So, the
similarity between drugs as chemical information is added to the computational methods to improve the prediction results. The question that arises here is whether this claim is actually true? If so, what method should be used to calculate drug-drug chemical structure similarities? Will we obtain the
same improvement from any DTI prediction method we use? Here, we investigated the amount of improvement that can be achieved by adding the drug-drug chemical structure similarities to the problem. For this purpose, we considered different types of real chemical similarities, random drug-drug
similarities, four gold standard datasets and four state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that the type and size of data, the method which is used to predict the interactions, and the algorithm used to calculate the chemical similarities between drugs are all important, and it cannot be easily
stated that adding drug-drug similarities can significantly improve the results. Therefore, our results could suggest a checklist for scientists who want to improve their machine learning methods."
"Accurate Prediction of Complex Structure and Affinity for a Flexible Protein Receptor and Its Inhibitor.. In order to predict the accurate binding configuration as well as the binding affinity for a flexible protein receptor and its inhibitor drug, enhanced sampling with multicanonical molecular dynamics (McMD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI) were combined as a general drug
docking method. CDK2, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, is involved in the cell cycle regulation. Malfunctions in CDK2 can cause tumorigenesis, and thus it is a potential drug target. Here, we performed a long McMD simulation for docking the inhibitor CS3 to CDK2 starting from the unbound structure.
Subsequently, a potential binding/unbinding pathway was given from the multicanonical ensemble, and the binding free energy was readily computed by TI along the pathway. Using this combination, the correct binding configuration of CS3 to CDK2 was obtained, and its affinity coincided well with the
experimental value."
"Coupled matrix-matrix and coupled tensor-matrix completion methods for predicting drug-target interactions.. Predicting the interactions between drugs and targets plays an important role in the process of new drug discovery, drug repurposing (also known as drug repositioning). There is a need to develop novel and efficient prediction approaches in order to avoid the costly and laborious process
of determining drug-target interactions (DTIs) based on experiments alone. These computational prediction approaches should be capable of identifying the potential DTIs in a timely manner. Matrix factorization methods have been proven to be the most reliable group of methods. Here, we first propose
a matrix factorization-based method termed 'Coupled Matrix-Matrix Completion' (CMMC). Next, in order to utilize more comprehensive information provided in different databases and incorporate multiple types of scores for drug-drug similarities and target-target relationship, we then extend CMMC to
'Coupled Tensor-Matrix Completion' (CTMC) by considering drug-drug and target-target similarity/interaction tensors. Results: Evaluation on two benchmark datasets, DrugBank and TTD, shows that CTMC outperforms the matrix-factorization-based methods: GRMF, $L_{2,1}$-GRMF, NRLMF and NRLMF$\beta $.
Based on the evaluation, CMMC and CTMC outperform the above three methods in term of area under the curve, F1 score, sensitivity and specificity in a considerably shorter run time."
"CFSBoost: Cumulative feature subspace boosting for drug-target interaction prediction.. Drug target interaction prediction is a very labor-intensive and expensive experimental process which has motivated researchers to focus on in silico prediction to provide information on potential interaction. In recent years, researchers have proposed several computational approaches for
predicting new drug target interactions. In this paper, we present CFSBoost, a simple and computationally cheap ensemble boosting classification model for identification and prediction of drug-target interactions using evolutionary and structural features. CFSBoost uses a simple yet novel feature
group selection procedure which allows the model to be computationally very cheap while being able to achieve state of the art performance. The ensemble model uses extra tree as weak learners inside a boosting scheme while holding on to the best model per iteration. We tested our method of four
benchmark datasets, which are also referred as gold standard datasets. Our method was able to achieve better score in terms of area under receiver operating characteristic (auROC) curve on 2 out of the 4 datasets. It was also able to achieve higher area under precision recall (auPR) curve on 3 out
of the 4 datasets. It has been argued by researchers that auPR metric is more suitable than auROC for comparison of performance on imbalanced datasets such our benchmark datasets. Our reported result shows that, despite of its simplicity in design, CFSBoost's performance is very satisfactory
comparing to other literatures. We also provide 5 new possible interactions for each dataset based on CFSBoost's prediction score."
"Prediction of the allergic mechanism of haptens via a reaction-substructure-compound-target-pathway network system.. Skin sensitization, frequently leading to allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), is authenticated to be a significant endpoint in the field of drug discovery and cosmetics. The initiation of ACD, also known as the skin sensitization mechanism, has been documented as an adverse outcome pathway
(AOP), which can be studied experimentally and computationally. In this study, we collected 154 haptens and applied systems toxicology methods to develop a reaction-substructure-compound- target-pathway network system. For the collected haptens, their key substructures were identified and associated
with their protein binding reactions. The targets of haptens, including the known targets collected from four databases and the potential targets predicted via our balanced substructure-drug-target network-based inference (bSDTNBI) method, were matched to skin proteins to obtain skin targets. The
dermatitis-related pathways were enriched and were subject to literature verification. The network system we developed can be applied to predict the reactions, targets and pathways of new haptens, which contributed to evaluating chemical safety and optimizing chemical structures. The study of skin
sensitization mechanism is helpful for understanding the skin immunity and resisting ACD."
"A Convolutional Neural Network System to Discriminate Drug-Target Interactions.. Biological targets are most commonly proteins such as enzymes, ion channels, and receptors. They are anything within a living organism to bind with some other entities (like an endogenous ligand or a drug), resulting in change in their behaviors or functions. Exploring potential
drug-target interactions (DTIs) are crucial for drug discovery and effective drug development. Computational methods were widely applied in drug-target interactions, since experimental methods are extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning-based
prediction system, with a new negative instance generation, to identify DTIs. As a result, our method achieved an accuracy of 0.9800 on our created dataset. Another dataset derived from DrugBank was used to further assess the generalization of the model, which yielded a good performance with
accuracy of 0.8814 and AUC value of 0.9527 on the dataset. The outcome of our experimental results indicated that the proposed method, involving the credible negative generation, can be employed to discriminate the interactions between drugs and targets. Website:

"Predicting drug target interactions using meta-path-based semantic network analysis.. In the context of drug discovery, drug target interactions (DTIs) can be predicted based on observed topological features of a semantic network across the chemical and biological space. In a semantic network, the types of the nodes and links are different. In order to take into account the
heterogeneity of the semantic network, meta-path-based topological patterns were investigated for link prediction. Supervised machine learning models were constructed based on meta-path topological features of an enriched semantic network, which was derived from Chem2Bio2RDF, and was expanded by
adding compound and protein similarity neighboring links obtained from the PubChem databases. The additional semantic links significantly improved the predictive performance of the supervised learning models. The binary classification model built upon the enriched feature space using the Random
Forest algorithm significantly outperformed an existing semantic link prediction algorithm, Semantic Link Association Prediction (SLAP), to predict unknown links between compounds and protein targets in an evolving network. In addition to link prediction, Random Forest also has an intrinsic feature
ranking algorithm, which can be used to select the important topological features that contribute to link prediction. The proposed framework has been demonstrated as a powerful alternative to SLAP in order to predict DTIs using the semantic network that integrates chemical, pharmacological, genomic,
biological, functional, and biomedical information into a unified framework. It offers the flexibility to enrich the feature space by using different normalization processes on the topological features, and it can perform model construction and feature selection at the same time."
"Multi-algorithm and multi-model based drug target prediction and web server.. To develop a reliable computational approach for predicting potential drug targets based merely on protein sequence. With drug target and non-target datasets prepared and 3 classification algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Neural Network and Decision Tree), a multi-algorithm and
multi-model based strategy was employed for constructing models to predict potential drug targets. Twenty one prediction models for each of the 3 algorithms were successfully developed. Our evaluation results showed that ∼30% of human proteins were potential drug targets, and ∼40% of putative
targets for the drugs undergoing phase II clinical trials were probably non-targets. A public web server named D3TPredictor (http://www.d3pharma.com/d3tpredictor) was constructed to provide easy access. Reliable and robust drug target prediction based on protein sequences is achieved using the
multi-algorithm and multi-model strategy."
"LDS-CNN: a deep learning framework for drug-target interactions prediction based on large-scale drug screening.. Drug-target interaction (DTI) is a vital drug design strategy that plays a significant role in many processes of complex diseases and cellular events. In the face of challenges such as extensive protein data and experimental costs, it is suggested to apply bioinformatics approaches to
exploit potential interactions to design new targeted medications. Different data and interaction types bring difficulties to study involving incompatible and heterology formats. The analysis of drug-target interactions in a comprehensive and unified model is a significant challenge. Here, we
propose a general method for predicting interactions between small-molecule drugs and protein targets, Large-scale Drug target Screening Convolutional Neural Network (LDS-CNN), which used unified encoding to achieve the calculation of the different data formats in an integrated model to realize
feature abstraction and potential object prediction. On 898,412 interaction data involving 1683 small-molecule compounds and 14,350 human proteins from 8.8 billion records, the proposed method achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96, an area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.95,
and an accuracy of 90.13%. The experimental results illustrated that the proposed method attained high accuracy on the test set, indicating its high predictive ability in drug-target interaction prediction. LDS-CNN is effective for the prediction of large-scale datasets and datasets composed of data
with different formats. In this study, we propose a DTI prediction method to solve the problems of unified encoding of large-scale data in multiple formats. It provides a feasible way to efficiently abstract the features among different types of drug-related data, thus reducing experimental costs
and time consumption. The proposed method can be used to identify potential drug targets and candidates for the treatment of complex diseases. This work provides a reference for DTI to process large-scale data and different formats with deep learning methods and provides certain suggestions for
future research."
"Network-based prediction of drug-target interactions using an arbitrary-order proximity embedded deep forest.. Systematic identification of molecular targets among known drugs plays an essential role in drug repurposing and understanding of their unexpected side effects. Computational approaches for prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs) are highly desired in comparison to traditional
experimental assays. Furthermore, recent advances of multiomics technologies and systems biology approaches have generated large-scale heterogeneous, biological networks, which offer unexpected opportunities for network-based identification of new molecular targets among known drugs. In this study,
we present a network-based computational framework, termed AOPEDF, an arbitrary-order proximity embedded deep forest approach, for prediction of DTIs. AOPEDF learns a low-dimensional vector representation of features that preserve arbitrary-order proximity from a highly integrated, heterogeneous
biological network connecting drugs, targets (proteins) and diseases. In total, we construct a heterogeneous network by uniquely integrating 15 networks covering chemical, genomic, phenotypic and network profiles among drugs, proteins/targets and diseases. Then, we build a cascade deep forest
classifier to infer new DTIs. Via systematic performance evaluation, AOPEDF achieves high accuracy in identifying molecular targets among known drugs on two external validation sets collected from DrugCentral [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.868] and ChEMBL (AUROC
= 0.768) databases, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods. In a case study, we showcase that multiple molecular targets predicted by AOPEDF are associated with mechanism-of-action of substance abuse disorder for several marketed drugs (such as aripiprazole, risperidone and haloperidol).

"Autoencoder-based drug-target interaction prediction by preserving the consistency of chemical properties and functions of drugs.. Exploring the potential drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a key step in drug discovery and repurposing. In recent years, predicting the probable DTIs through computational methods has gradually become a research hot spot. However, most of the previous studies failed to judiciously take
into account the consistency between the chemical properties of drug and its functions. The changes of these relationships may lead to a severely negative effect on the prediction of DTIs. We propose an autoencoder-based method, AEFS, under spatial consistency constraints to predict DTIs. A
heterogeneous network is established to integrate the information of drugs, proteins and diseases. The original drug features are projected to an embedding (protein) space by a multi-layer encoder, and further projected into label (disease) space by a decoder. In this process, the clinical
information of drugs is introduced to assist the DTI prediction. By maintaining the distribution of drug correlation in the original feature, embedding and label space, AEFS keeps the consistency between chemical properties and functions of drugs. Experimental comparisons indicate that AEFS is more
robust for imbalanced data and of significantly superior performance in DTI prediction. Case studies further confirm its ability to mine the latent DTIs. The code of AEFS is available at https://github.com/JackieSun818/AEFS. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
"FPSC-DTI: drug-target interaction prediction based on feature projection fuzzy classification and super cluster fusion.. Identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) is an important part of drug discovery and development. However, identifying DTIs is a complex process that is time consuming, costly, long, and often inefficient, with a low success rate, especially with wet-experimental methods. Computational
methods based on drug repositioning and network pharmacology can effectively overcome these defects. In this paper, we develop a new fusion method, called FPSC-DTI, that fuses feature projection fuzzy classification (FP) and super cluster classification (SC) to predict DTI. As the experimental
result, the mean percentile ranking (MPR) that was yielded by FPSC-DTI achieved 0.043, 0.084, 0.072, and 0.146 on enzyme, ion channel (IC), G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), and nuclear receptor (NR) datasets, respectively. And the AUC values exceeded 0.969 over all four datasets. Compared with
other methods, FPSC-DTI obtained better predictive performance and became more robust."
"Quantitative Prediction of Multivalent Ligand-Receptor Binding Affinities for Influenza, Cholera, and Anthrax Inhibition.. Multivalency achieves strong, yet reversible binding by the simultaneous formation of multiple weak bonds. It is a key interaction principle in biology and promising for the synthesis of high-affinity inhibitors of pathogens. We present a molecular model for the binding affinity of
synthetic multivalent ligands onto multivalent receptors consisting of n receptor units arranged on a regular polygon. Ligands consist of a geometrically matching rigid polygonal core to which monovalent ligand units are attached via flexible linker polymers, closely mimicking existing experimental
designs. The calculated binding affinities quantitatively agree with experimental studies for cholera toxin ( n = 5) and anthrax receptor ( n = 7) and allow to predict optimal core size and optimal linker length. Maximal binding affinity is achieved for a core that matches the receptor size and for
linkers that have an equilibrium end-to-end distance that is slightly longer than the geometric separation between ligand core and receptor sites. Linkers that are longer than optimal are greatly preferable compared to shorter linkers. The angular steric restriction between ligand unit and linker
polymer is shown to be a key parameter. We construct an enhancement diagram that quantifies the multivalent binding affinity compared to monovalent ligands. We conclude that multivalent ligands against influenza viral hemagglutinin ( n = 3), cholera toxin ( n = 5), and anthrax receptor ( n = 7) can
outperform monovalent ligands only for a monovalent ligand affinity that exceeds a core-size dependent threshold value. Thus, multivalent drug design needs to balance core size, linker length, as well as monovalent ligand unit affinity."
"MHADTI: predicting drug-target interactions via multiview heterogeneous information network embedding with hierarchical attention mechanisms.. Discovering the drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a crucial step in drug development such as the identification of drug side effects and drug repositioning. Since identifying DTIs by web-biological experiments is time-consuming and costly, many computational-based approaches have been
proposed and have become an efficient manner to infer the potential interactions. Although extensive effort is invested to solve this task, the prediction accuracy still needs to be improved. More especially, heterogeneous network-based approaches do not fully consider the complex structure and rich
semantic information in these heterogeneous networks. Therefore, it is still a challenge to predict DTIs efficiently. In this study, we develop a novel method via Multiview heterogeneous information network embedding with Hierarchical Attention mechanisms to discover potential Drug-Target
Interactions (MHADTI). Firstly, MHADTI constructs different similarity networks for drugs and targets by utilizing their multisource information. Combined with the known DTI network, three drug-target heterogeneous information networks (HINs) with different views are established. Secondly, MHADTI
learns embeddings of drugs and targets from multiview HINs with hierarchical attention mechanisms, which include the node-level, semantic-level and graph-level attentions. Lastly, MHADTI employs the multilayer perceptron to predict DTIs with the learned deep feature representations. The hierarchical
attention mechanisms could fully consider the importance of nodes, meta-paths and graphs in learning the feature representations of drugs and targets, which makes their embeddings more comprehensively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MHADTI performs better than other SOTA prediction
models. Moreover, analysis of prediction results for some interested drugs and targets further indicates that MHADTI has advantages in discovering DTIs. https://github.com/pxystudy/MHADTI."
"Prediction of drug side effects with transductive matrix co-completion.. Side effects of drugs could cause severe health problems and the failure of drug development. Drug-target interactions are the basis for side effect production and are important for side effect prediction. However, the information on the known targets of drugs is incomplete. Furthermore,
there could be also some missing data in the existing side effect profile of drugs. As a result, new methods are needed to deal with the missing features and missing labels in the problem of side effect prediction. We propose a novel computational method based on transductive matrix co-completion
and leverage the low-rank structure in the side effects and drug-target data. Positive-unlabelled learning is incorporated into the model to handle the impact of unobserved data. We also introduce graph regularization to integrate the drug chemical information for side effect prediction. We collect
the data on side effects, drug targets, drug-associated proteins and drug chemical structures to train our model and test its performance for side effect prediction. The experiment results show that our method outperforms several other state-of-the-art methods under different scenarios. The case
study and additional analysis illustrate that the proposed method could not only predict the side effects of drugs but also could infer the missing targets of drugs. The data and the code for the proposed method are available at https://github.com/LiangXujun/GTMCC. Supplementary data are available
at Bioinformatics online."
"GanDTI: A multi-task neural network for drug-target interaction prediction.. Drug discovery processes require drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction by virtual screenings with high accuracy. Compared with traditional methods, the deep learning method requires less time and domain expertise, while achieving higher accuracy. However, there is still room for
improvement for higher performance with simplified structures. Meanwhile, this field is calling for multi-task models to solve different tasks. Here we report the GanDTI, an end-to-end deep learning model for both interaction classification and binding affinity prediction tasks. This model employs
the compound graph and protein sequence data. It only consists of a graph neural network, an attention module and a multiple-layer perceptron, yet outperforms the state-of-the art methods to predict binding affinity and interaction classification on the DUD-E, human, and bindingDB benchmark
datasets. This demonstrates our refined model is highly effective and efficient for DTI prediction and provides a new strategy for performance improvement."
"EDC-DTI: An end-to-end deep collaborative learning model based on multiple information for drug-target interactions prediction.. Innovations in drug-target interactions (DTIs) prediction accelerate the progression of drug development. The introduction of deep learning models has a dramatic impact on DTIs prediction, with a distinct influence on saving time and money in drug discovery. This study develops an
end-to-end deep collaborative learning model for DTIs prediction, called EDC-DTI, to identify new targets for existing drugs based on multiple drug-target-related information including homogeneous information and heterogeneous information by the way of deep learning. Our end-to-end model is composed
of a feature builder and a classifier. Feature builder consists of two collaborative feature construction algorithms that extract the molecular properties and the topology property of networks, and the classifier consists of a feature encoder and a feature decoder which are designed for feature
integration and DTIs prediction, respectively. The feature encoder, mainly based on the improved graph attention network, incorporates heterogeneous information into drug features and target features separately. The feature decoder is composed of multiple neural networks for predictions. Compared
with six popular baseline models, EDC-DTI achieves highest predictive performance in the case of low computational costs. Robustness tests demonstrate that EDC-DTI is able to maintain strong predictive performance on sparse datasets. As well, we use the model to predict the most likely targets to
interact with Simvastatin (DB00641), Nifedipine (DB01115) and Afatinib (DB08916) as examples. Results show that most of the predictions can be confirmed by literature with clear evidence."
"Drug-target interaction prediction via class imbalance-aware ensemble learning.. Multiple computational methods for predicting drug-target interactions have been developed to facilitate the drug discovery process. These methods use available data on known drug-target interactions to train classifiers with the purpose of predicting new undiscovered interactions.
However, a key challenge regarding this data that has not yet been addressed by these methods, namely class imbalance, is potentially degrading the prediction performance. Class imbalance can be divided into two sub-problems. Firstly, the number of known interacting drug-target pairs is much smaller
than that of non-interacting drug-target pairs. This imbalance ratio between interacting and non-interacting drug-target pairs is referred to as the between-class imbalance. Between-class imbalance degrades prediction performance due to the bias in prediction results towards the majority class (i.e.
the non-interacting pairs), leading to more prediction errors in the minority class (i.e. the interacting pairs). Secondly, there are multiple types of drug-target interactions in the data with some types having relatively fewer members (or are less represented) than others. This variation in
representation of the different interaction types leads to another kind of imbalance referred to as the within-class imbalance. In within-class imbalance, prediction results are biased towards the better represented interaction types, leading to more prediction errors in the less represented
interaction types. We propose an ensemble learning method that incorporates techniques to address the issues of between-class imbalance and within-class imbalance. Experiments show that the proposed method improves results over 4 state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we simulated cases for new
drugs and targets to see how our method would perform in predicting their interactions. New drugs and targets are those for which no prior interactions are known. Our method displayed satisfactory prediction performance and was able to predict many of the interactions successfully. Our proposed
method has improved the prediction performance over the existing work, thus proving the importance of addressing problems pertaining to class imbalance in the data."
"FusionDTA: attention-based feature polymerizer and knowledge distillation for drug-target binding affinity prediction.. The prediction of drug-target affinity (DTA) plays an increasingly important role in drug discovery. Nowadays, lots of prediction methods focus on feature encoding of drugs and proteins, but ignore the importance of feature aggregation. However, the increasingly complex encoder networks
lead to the loss of implicit information and excessive model size. To this end, we propose a deep-learning-based approach namely FusionDTA. For the loss of implicit information, a novel muti-head linear attention mechanism was utilized to replace the rough pooling method. This allows FusionDTA
aggregates global information based on attention weights, instead of selecting the largest one as max-pooling does. To solve the redundancy issue of parameters, we applied knowledge distillation in FusionDTA by transfering learnable information from teacher model to student. Results show that
FusionDTA performs better than existing models for the test domain on all evaluation metrics. We obtained concordance index (CI) index of 0.913 and 0.906 in Davis and KIBA dataset respectively, compared with 0.893 and 0.891 of previous state-of-art model. Under the cold-start constrain, our model
proved to be more robust and more effective with unseen inputs than baseline methods. In addition, the knowledge distillation did save half of the parameters of the model, with only 0.006 reduction in CI index. Even FusionDTA with half the parameters could easily exceed the baseline on all metrics.
In general, our model has superior performance and improves the effect of drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction. The visualization of DTI can effectively help predict the binding region of proteins during structure-based drug design."
"Recent Advances in the Machine Learning-Based Drug-Target Interaction Prediction.. The identification of drug-target interactions is a crucial issue in drug discovery. In recent years, researchers have made great efforts on the drug-target interaction predictions, and developed databases, software and computational methods. In the paper, we review the recent advances in
machine learning-based drug-target interaction prediction. First, we briefly introduce the datasets and data, and summarize features for drugs and targets which can be extracted from different data. Since drug-drug similarity and target-target similarity are important for many machine learning
prediction models, we introduce how to calculate similarities based on data or features. Different machine learningbased drug-target interaction prediction methods can be proposed by using different features or information. Thus, we summarize, analyze and compare different machine learning-based
prediction methods. This study provides the guide to the development of computational methods for the drug-target interaction prediction."
"Improving prediction of drug-target interactions based on fusing multiple features with data balancing and feature selection techniques.. Drug discovery relies on predicting drug-target interaction (DTI), which is an important challenging task. The purpose of DTI is to identify the interaction between drug chemical compounds and protein targets. Traditional wet lab experiments are time-consuming and expensive, that's why in
recent years, the use of computational methods based on machine learning has attracted the attention of many researchers. Actually, a dry lab environment focusing more on computational methods of interaction prediction can be helpful in limiting search space for wet lab experiments. In this paper, a
novel multi-stage approach for DTI is proposed that called SRX-DTI. In the first stage, combination of various descriptors from protein sequences, and a FP2 fingerprint that is encoded from drug are extracted as feature vectors. A major challenge in this application is the imbalanced data due to the
lack of known interactions, in this regard, in the second stage, the One-SVM-US technique is proposed to deal with this problem. Next, the FFS-RF algorithm, a forward feature selection algorithm, coupled with a random forest (RF) classifier is developed to maximize the predictive performance. This
feature selection algorithm removes irrelevant features to obtain optimal features. Finally, balanced dataset with optimal features is given to the XGBoost classifier to identify DTIs. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach SRX-DTI achieves higher performance than other
existing methods in predicting DTIs. The datasets and source code are available at: https://github.com/Khojasteh-hb/SRX-DTI."
"ZeroBind: a protein-specific zero-shot predictor with subgraph matching for drug-target interactions.. Existing drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction methods generally fail to generalize well to novel (unseen) proteins and drugs. In this study, we propose a protein-specific meta-learning framework ZeroBind with subgraph matching for predicting protein-drug interactions from their
structures. During the meta-training process, ZeroBind formulates training a protein-specific model, which is also considered a learning task, and each task uses graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the protein graph embedding and the molecular graph embedding. Inspired by the fact that molecules
bind to a binding pocket in proteins instead of the whole protein, ZeroBind introduces a weakly supervised subgraph information bottleneck (SIB) module to recognize the maximally informative and compressive subgraphs in protein graphs as potential binding pockets. In addition, ZeroBind trains the
models of individual proteins as multiple tasks, whose importance is automatically learned with a task adaptive self-attention module to make final predictions. The results show that ZeroBind achieves superior performance on DTI prediction over existing methods, especially for those unseen proteins
and drugs, and performs well after fine-tuning for those proteins or drugs with a few known binding partners."
"Shedding Light on the Drug-Target Prediction of the Anti-Inflammatory Peptide <i>Tn</i>P with Bioinformatics Tools.. Peptide-protein interactions are involved in various fundamental cellular functions, and their identification is crucial for designing efficacious peptide therapeutics. Drug-target interactions can be inferred by in silico prediction using bioinformatics and computational tools. We
patented the <i>Tn</i>P family of synthetic cyclic peptides, which is in the preclinical stage of developmental studies for chronic inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis. In an experimental autoimmune enceph-alomyelitis model, we found that <i>Tn</i>P controls neuroinflammation and
prevents demyelination due to its capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier and to act in the central nervous system blocking the migration of inflammatory cells responsible for neuronal degeneration. Therefore, the identification of potential targets for <i>Tn</i>P is the objective of this
research. In this study, we used bioinformatics and computational approaches, as well as bioactivity databases, to evaluate <i>Tn</i>P-target prediction for proteins that were not experimentally tested, specifically predicting the 3D structure of <i>Tn</i>P and its biochemical characteristics,
<i>Tn</i>P-target protein binding and docking properties, and dynamics of <i>Tn</i>P competition for the protein/receptor complex interaction, construction of a network of con-nectivity and interactions between molecules as a result of <i>Tn</i>P blockade, and analysis of similarities with bioactive
molecules. Based on our results, integrins were identified as important key proteins and considered responsible to regulate <i>Tn</i>P-governed pharmacological effects. This comprehensive in silico study will help to understand how <i>Tn</i>P induces its anti-inflammatory effects and will also
facilitate the identification of possible side effects, as it shows its link with multiple biologically important targets in humans."
"Fine-tuning of BERT Model to Accurately Predict Drug-Target Interactions.. The identification of optimal drug candidates is very important in drug discovery. Researchers in biology and computational sciences have sought to use machine learning (ML) to efficiently predict drug-target interactions (DTIs). In recent years, according to the emerging usefulness of
pretrained models in natural language process (NLPs), pretrained models are being developed for chemical compounds and target proteins. This study sought to improve DTI predictive models using a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers (BERT)-pretrained model, ChemBERTa, for
chemical compounds. Pretraining features the use of a simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES). We also employ the pretrained ProBERT for target proteins (pretraining employed the amino acid sequences). The BIOSNAP, DAVIS, and BindingDB databases (DBs) were used (alone or together) for
learning. The final model, taught by both ChemBERTa and ProtBert and the integrated DBs, afforded the best DTI predictive performance to date based on the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) and precision-recall-AUC values compared with previous models. The performance of
the final model was verified using a specific case study on 13 pairs of subtrates and the metabolic enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP). The final model afforded excellent DTI prediction. As the real-world interactions between drugs and target proteins are expected to exhibit specific patterns, pretraining
with ChemBERTa and ProtBert could teach such patterns. Learning the patterns of such interactions would enhance DTI accuracy if learning employs large, well-balanced datasets that cover all relationships between drugs and target proteins."
"MSGNN-DTA: Multi-Scale Topological Feature Fusion Based on Graph Neural Networks for Drug-Target Binding Affinity Prediction.. The accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity (DTA) is an essential step in drug discovery and drug repositioning. Although deep learning methods have been widely adopted for DTA prediction, the complexity of extracting drug and target protein features hampers the accuracy of
these predictions. In this study, we propose a novel model for DTA prediction named MSGNN-DTA, which leverages a fused multi-scale topological feature approach based on graph neural networks (GNNs). To address the challenge of accurately extracting drug and target protein features, we introduce a
gated skip-connection mechanism during the feature learning process to fuse multi-scale topological features, resulting in information-rich representations of drugs and proteins. Our approach constructs drug atom graphs, motif graphs, and weighted protein graphs to fully extract topological
information and provide a comprehensive understanding of underlying molecular interactions from multiple perspectives. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGNN-DTA outperforms the state-of-the-art models in all evaluation metrics, showcasing the effectiveness of the
proposed approach. Moreover, the study conducts a case study based on already FDA-approved drugs in the DrugBank dataset to highlight the potential of the MSGNN-DTA framework in identifying drug candidates for specific targets, which could accelerate the process of virtual screening and drug
repositioning."
"Weak-binding molecules are not drugs?-toward a systematic strategy for finding effective weak-binding drugs.. Designing maximally selective ligands that act on individual drug targets with high binding affinity has been the central dogma of drug discovery and development for the past two decades. However, many low-affinity drugs that aim for several targets at the same time are found more
effective than the high-affinity binders when faced with complex disease conditions, such as cancers, Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this study was to appreciate the importance and reveal the features of weak-binding drugs and propose an integrated strategy for
discovering them. Weak-binding drugs can be characterized by their high dissociation rates and transient interactions with their targets. In addition, network topologies and dynamics parameters involved in the targets of weak-binding drugs also influence the effects of the drugs. Here, we first
performed a dynamics analysis for 33 elementary subgraphs to determine the desirable topology and dynamics parameters among targets. Then, by applying the elementary subgraphs to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, several optimal target combinations were obtained. Combining
drug-target interaction prediction with molecular dynamics simulation, we got two potential weak-binding drug candidates, luteolin and tanshinone IIA, acting on these targets. Further, the binding affinity of these two compounds to their targets and the anti-inflammatory effects of them were
validated through in vitro experiments. In conclusion, weak-binding drugs have real opportunities for maximum efficiency and may show reduced adverse reactions, which can offer a bright and promising future for new drug discovery."
"Old drug repositioning and new drug discovery through similarity learning from drug-target joint feature spaces.. Detection of new drug-target interactions by computational algorithms is of crucial value to both old drug repositioning and new drug discovery. Existing machine-learning methods rely only on experimentally validated drug-target interactions (i.e., positive samples) for the predictions.
Their performance is severely impeded by the lack of reliable negative samples. We propose a method to construct highly-reliable negative samples for drug target prediction by a pairwise drug-target similarity measurement and OCSVM with a high-recall constraint. On one hand, we measure the pairwise
similarity between every two drug-target interactions by combining the chemical similarity between their drugs and the Gene Ontology-based similarity between their targets. Then we calculate the accumulative similarity with all known drug-target interactions for each unobserved drug-target
interaction. On the other hand, we obtain the signed distance from OCSVM learned from the known interactions with high recall (≥0.95) for each unobserved drug-target interaction. After normalizing all accumulative similarities and signed distances to the range [0,1], we compute the score for each
unobserved drug-target interaction via averaging its accumulative similarity and signed distance. Unobserved interactions with lower scores are preferentially served as reliable negative samples for the classification algorithms. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the interaction
data between 1094 drugs and 1556 target proteins. Extensive comparison experiments using four classical classifiers and one domain predictive method demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. A better decision boundary has been learned from the constructed reliable negative
samples. Proper construction of highly-reliable negative samples can help the classification models learn a clear decision boundary which contributes to the performance improvement."
"Fast and accurate protein function prediction from sequence through pretrained language model and homology-based label diffusion.. Protein function prediction is an essential task in bioinformatics which benefits disease mechanism elucidation and drug target discovery. Due to the explosive growth of proteins in sequence databases and the diversity of their functions, it remains challenging to fast and accurately
predict protein functions from sequences alone. Although many methods have integrated protein structures, biological networks or literature information to improve performance, these extra features are often unavailable for most proteins. Here, we propose SPROF-GO, a Sequence-based alignment-free
PROtein Function predictor, which leverages a pretrained language model to efficiently extract informative sequence embeddings and employs self-attention pooling to focus on important residues. The prediction is further advanced by exploiting the homology information and accounting for the
overlapping communities of proteins with related functions through the label diffusion algorithm. SPROF-GO was shown to surpass state-of-the-art sequence-based and even network-based approaches by more than 14.5, 27.3 and 10.1% in area under the precision-recall curve on the three sub-ontology test
sets, respectively. Our method was also demonstrated to generalize well on non-homologous proteins and unseen species. Finally, visualization based on the attention mechanism indicated that SPROF-GO is able to capture sequence domains useful for function prediction. The datasets, source codes and
trained models of SPROF-GO are available at https://github.com/biomed-AI/SPROF-GO. The SPROF-GO web server is freely available at http://bio-web1.nscc-gz.cn/app/sprof-go."
"Machine learning on ligand-residue interaction profiles to significantly improve binding affinity prediction.. Structure-based virtual screenings (SBVSs) play an important role in drug discovery projects. However, it is still a challenge to accurately predict the binding affinity of an arbitrary molecule binds to a drug target and prioritize top ligands from an SBVS. In this study, we developed a
novel method, using ligand-residue interaction profiles (IPs) to construct machine learning (ML)-based prediction models, to significantly improve the screening performance in SBVSs. Such a kind of the prediction model is called an IP scoring function (IP-SF). We systematically investigated how to
improve the performance of IP-SFs from many perspectives, including the sampling methods before interaction energy calculation and different ML algorithms. Using six drug targets with each having hundreds of known ligands, we conducted a critical evaluation on the developed IP-SFs. The IP-SFs
employing a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm in conjunction with the MIN + GB simulation protocol achieved the best overall performance. Its scoring power, ranking power and screening power significantly outperformed the Glide SF. First, compared with Glide, the average values of
mean absolute error and root mean square error of GBDT/MIN + GB decreased about 38 and 36%, respectively. Second, the mean values of squared correlation coefficient and predictive index increased about 225 and 73%, respectively. Third, more encouragingly, the average value of the areas under the
curve of receiver operating characteristic for six targets by GBDT, 0.87, is significantly better than that by Glide, which is only 0.71. Thus, we expected IP-SFs to have broad and promising applications in SBVSs."
"A Machine Learning-Based Biological Drug-Target Interaction Prediction Method for a Tripartite Heterogeneous Network.. Drug repositioning is the identification of interactions between drugs and target proteins in pharmaceutical sciences. Traditional large-scale validation through chemical experiments is time-consuming and expensive, while drug repositioning can drastically decrease the cost and duration
taken by traditional drug development. With the rapid advancement of high-throughput technologies and the explosion of various biological and medical data, computational drug repositioning methods have been used to systematically identify potential drug-target interactions. Some of them are based on
a particular class of machine learning algorithms called kernel methods. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning prediction method combining multiple kernels into a tripartite heterogeneous drug-target-disease interaction spaces in order to integrate multiple sources of biological
information simultaneously. This novel network algorithm extends the traditional drug-target interaction bipartite graph to the third disease layer. Meanwhile, Gaussian kernel functions on heterogeneous networks and the regularized least square method of the Kronecker product are used to predict new
drug-target interactions. The values of AUPR (area under the precision-recall curve) and AUC (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of the proposed algorithm are significantly improved. Especially, the AUC values are improved to 0.99, 0.99, 0.97, and 0.96 on four benchmark data
sets. These experimental results substantiate that the network topology can be used for predicting drug-target interactions."
